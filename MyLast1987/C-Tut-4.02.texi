@unnumbered Preface

Every program is limited by the language which is used to write it.  C
is a programmer's language. Unlike BASIC or Pascal, C was not written as
a teaching aid, but as an implementation language. C is a computer
language and a programming tool which has grown popular because
programmers like it! It is a tricky language but a masterful
one. Sceptics have said that it is a language in which everything which
can go wrong does go wrong. True, it does not do much hand holding, but
also it does not hold anything back. If you have come to C in the hope
of finding a powerful language for writing everyday computer programs,
then you will not be disappointed. C is ideally suited to modern
computers and modern programming.

This book is a tutorial. Its aim is to teach C to a beginner, but with
enough of the details so as not to be outgrown as the years go by.  It
presumes that you have some previous aquaintance with programming ---
you need to know what a variable is and what a function is --- but you
do not need much experience.  It is not essential to follow the order of
the chapters rigorously, but if you are a beginner to C it is
recommended. When it comes down to it, most languages have basically
the same kinds of features: variables, ways of making loops, ways of
making decisions, ways of accessing files etc. If you want to plan
your assault on C, think about what you already know about programming
and what you expect to look for in C. You will most likely find all of
those things and more, as you work through the chapters.

The example programs range from quick one-function programs,
which do no more than illustrate the sole use of one simple feature,
to complete application examples occupying several pages. In places
these examples make use of features before they have properly been
explained. These programs serve as a taster of what is to come.

@section High Levels and Low Levels

@cindex Levels of detail
@cindex Low level
@cindex High level
     Any kind of object that is sufficiently complicated can be
thought of as having levels of detail; the amount of detail we see
depends upon how closely we scrutinize it.  A computer falls definitely
into the category of complex objects and it can be thought of as working
at many different levels.  The terms @emph{low level} and @emph{high
level} are often used to describe these onion-layers of complexity in
computers.  Low level is perhaps the easiest to understand:  it describes
a level of detail which is buried down amongst the working parts of the
machine:  the low level is the level at which the computer seems most
primitive and machine-like.  A higher level describes the same object,
but with the detail left out.  Imagine stepping back from the complexity
of the machine level pieces and grouping together parts which work
together, then covering up all the details.  (For instance, in a car, a
group of nuts, bolts, pistons can be grouped together to make up a new
basic object:  an engine.)  At a high level a computer becomes a group of
black boxes which can then be thought of as the basic components of the
computer.

     C is called a high level, compiler language.  The aim of any high
level computer language is to provide an easy and natural way of giving
a programme of instructions to a computer (a computer program).  The
language of the raw computer is a stream of numbers called machine
code.  As you might expect, the action which results from a single
machine code instruction is very primitive and many thousands of them
are required to make a program which does anything substantial.  It is
therefore the job of a high level language to provide a new set of
black box instructions, which can be given to the computer without us
needing to see what happens inside them -- and it is the job of a
compiler to fill in the details of these "black boxes" so that the final
product is a sequence of instructions in the language of the computer.

@image{img/1.1,12cm}

     C is one of a large number of high level languages which can be
used for general purpose programming, that is, anything from writing
small programs for personal amusement to writing complex applications.  It
is unusual in several ways.  Before C, high level languages were
criticized by machine code programmers because they shielded the user
from the working details of the computer, with their black box approach,
to such an extent that the languages become inflexible:  in other words,
they did not allow programmers to use all the facilities which the
machine has to offer.  C, on the other hand, was designed to give access
to any level of the machine down to raw machine code and because of this
it is perhaps the most flexible of all high level languages.

@image{img/1.2,12cm}

     Surprisingly, programming books often ignore an important role of
high level languages:  high level programs are not only a way to express
instructions to the computer, they are also a means of communication
among human beings.  They are not merely monologues to the machine, they
are a way to express ideas and a way to solve problems.  The C
language has been equipped with features that allow programs to be
organized in an easy and logical way.  This is vitally important for
writing lengthy programs because complex problems are only manageable
with a clear organization and program structure.  C allows meaningful
variable names and meaningful function names to be used in programs
without any loss of efficiency and it gives a complete freedom of style;
it has a set of very flexible loop constructions (@code{for},
@code{while}, @code{do}) and neat ways of making decisions.  These
provide an excellent basis for controlling the flow of programs.

@image{img/1.3,12cm}

     Another unusual feature of C is the way it can express ideas
concisely.  The richness of a language shapes what it can talk about.  C
gives us the apparatus to build neat and compact programs.  This
sounds, first of all, either like a great bonus or something a bit
suspect.  Its conciseness can be a mixed blessing:  the aim is to try to
seek a balance between the often conflicting interests of readability of
programs and their conciseness.  Because this side of programming is so
often presumed to be understood, we shall try to develop a style which
finds the right balance.

     C allows things which are disallowed in other languages:  this
is no defect, but a very powerful freedom which, when used with caution,
opens up possibilities enormously.  It does mean however that there are
aspects of C which can run away with themselves unless some care is
taken.  The programmer carries an extra responsibility to write a
careful and thoughtful program.  The reward for this care is that 
fast, efficient programs can be produced.

@cindex Local environment
     C tries to make the best of a computer by linking as closely as
possible to the local environment.  It is no longer necessary to have to
put up with hopelessly inadequate input/output facilities anymore (a
legacy of the timesharing/mainframe computer era):  one can use
everything that a computer has to offer.  Above all it is flexible.
Clearly no language can guarantee intrinsically good programs:  there is
always a responsibility on the programmer, personally, to ensure that a
program is neat, logical and well organized, but it can give a framework
in which it is easy to do so.

     The aim of this book is to convey some of the C philosophy in a
practical way and to provide a comprehensive introduction to the
language by appealing to a number of examples and by sticking to a
strict structuring scheme.  It is hoped that this will give a flavour
of the kind of programming which C encourages.

@emph{What to do with a compiler.  What can go wrong.}
@sp 1

@cindex Compiler
     Using a compiler language is not the same as using an interpreted
language like BASIC or a GNU shell.  It differs in a number of ways.  To
begin with, a C program has to be created in two stages:

@itemize @bullet
@item 
Firstly, the program is written in the form of a number of text files
using a screen editor.  This form of the program is called the
@emph{source program}.  It is not possible to execute this file directly.
@cindex Screen editor
@cindex Shell

@item
Secondly, the completed source file is passed to a compiler---a program which
generates a new file containing a machine code translation of the source
text.  This file is called an object file or executable file.  The
executable file is said to have been compiled from the source text.
@end itemize

Compiler languages do not usually contain their own editor, nor do they
have words like @samp{RUN} with which to execute a finished program.  You
use a screen editor to create the words of a program (program text) and
run the final program in its compiled form usually by simply typing the
name of the executable file.


@menu

* Errors::                      
@end menu

@node The compiler, Errors, Basic ideas, Introduction
@section The Compiler

     A C program is made by running a @emph{compiler} which takes the
typed source program and converts it into an object file that the
computer can execute.  A compiler usually operates in two or more phases
(and each phase may have stages within it).  These phases must be
executed one after the other.  As we shall see later, this approach
provides a flexible way of compiling programs which are split into many
files.

@image{img/1.4,12cm}

A two-phase compiler works in the following way:

@itemize @bullet

@item 
Phase 1 scans a source program, perhaps generating an intermediate code
(quadruples or pcode) which helps to simplify the grammar of the
language for subsequent processing.  It then converts the intermediate
code into a file of object code (though this is usually not executable
yet).  A separate object file is built for each separate source file.  In
the GNU C compiler, these two stages are run with the command @code{gcc
-c}; the output is one or more @code{.o} files.

@item
Phase 2 is a Linker.  This program appends standard library code to the
object file so that the code is complete and can "stand alone".  A C
compiler linker suffers the slightly arduous task of linking together
all the functions in the C program.  Even at this stage, the compiler
can fail, if it finds that it has a reference to a function which does
not exist.  With the GNU C compiler this stage is activated by the command
@code{gcc -o} or @code{ld}.
@end itemize
@cindex Phases of compilation
@cindex Compiler phases
@cindex Linker

@noindent
To avoid the irritation of typing two or three separate commands (which
are often cumbersome) you will normally find a simple interface
for executing the compiler. Traditionally this is an executable
program called @code{cc} for C Compiler:

@example
@group
cc @var{filename}

gcc @var{filename}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
On GNU systems, this results in the creation of an executable 
program with the default name @code{a.out}. To tell the compiler
what you would like the executable program to be called, 
use the @code{-o} option for setting the name of the object code:
@cindex a.out

@example
gcc -o @var{program-name} @var{filename}
@end example

@noindent
For example, to create a program called @file{myprog} from a file
called @code{myprog.c}, write

@example
gcc -o myprog myprog.c
@end example
@cindex gcc
@cindex GNU compiler

@node Errors, Use of Upper and Lower Case, The compiler, Introduction
@section Errors

Errors are mistakes which we the programmers make.
There are different kinds of error:

@table @emph
@item Syntax

Errors in the syntax, or word structure of a program are caught
before you run it, at compilation time by the compiler program.  They
are listed all in one go, with the line number, in the text file, at
which the error occurred and a message to say what was wrong. 
@cindex Errors, programming
@cindex Syntax error

For example, suppose you write @code{sin (x) y = ;} in a program instead
of @code{y = sin (x);}, which assigns the value of the sin of @samp{x}
to @samp{y}.  Upon compilation, you would see this error message:

@example
eg.c: In function `main':
eg.c:12: parse error before `y'
@end example

@noindent
(If you compile the program in Emacs, you can jump directly to the error.)
@c !!! need xref to Compiling and Debugging with Emacs and GDB

A program with syntax errors will cause a compiler program to stop
trying to generate machine code and will not create an executable.
However, a compiler will usually not stop at the first error it
encounters but will attempt to continue checking the syntax of a program
right to the last line before aborting, and it is common to submit a
program for compilation only to receive a long and ungratifying list of
errors from the compiler.

It is a shock to everyone using a compiler for the first time how a
single error can throw the compiler off course and result in a huge and
confusing list of non-existent errors, following a single true
culprit. The situation thus looks much worse than it really is. You'll
get used to this with experience, but it can be very disheartening.

As a rule, look for the @emph{first} error, fix that, and then
recompile.  Of course, after you have become experienced, you will
recognize when subsequent error messages are due to independent problems
and when they are due to a cascade.  But at the beginning, just look for
and fix the first error.

@c  !!! Bob left out an initially included item on errors of logic 
@c  since they seem to be similar to the next item errors of goal or
@c  purpose, where you create a program the compiler thinks is correct, but
@c  which does not do what you want.  Also, on a GNU system, it is unlikely
@c  that a logical error will cause the computer to run wild and jam the
@c  normal operation of the computer.

@c  !!! What would be a good example of an error of logic?

@item Intention

@cindex Logical errors
@cindex Errors, of purpose
Errors in goal or purpose (logical errors) occur when you write a program that works, but
does not do what you intend it to do.  You intend to send a letter to
all drivers whose licenses will expire soon; instead, you send a letter
to all drivers whose licenses will expire sometime.
@end table

     If the compilation of a program is successful, then a new file is
created.  This file will contain machine code which can be executed
according to the rules of the computer's local operating system.

     When a programmer wants to make alterations and corrections to a C
program, these have to be made in the source text file itself using an
editor; the program, or the salient parts, must then be recompiled.

@node Use of Upper and Lower Case, Questions 1, Errors, Introduction
@section Use of Upper and Lower Case

@cindex Case, upper and lower
     One of the reasons why the compiler can fail to produce the
executable file for a program is you have mistyped something, even
through the careless use of upper and lower case characters.  The C
language is @emph{case dependent}.  Unlike languages such as Pascal and
some versions of BASIC, the C compiler distinguishes between small
letters and capital letters. This is a potential source of quite trivial
errors which can be difficult to spot.  If a letter is typed in the
wrong case, the compiler will complain and it will not produce an
executable program.

@section Declarations

@cindex Declarations
@cindex Variables
    Compiler languages require us to make a list of the names and types
of all variables which are going to be used in a program and provide
information about where they are going to be used.  This is called
@emph{declaring} variables.  It serves two purposes:  firstly, it
provides the compiler with a definitive list of the variables, enabling
it to cross check for errors, and secondly, it informs the compiler how
much space must be reserved for each variable when the program is run.
C supports a variety of variable types (variables which hold different
kinds of data) and allows one type to be converted into another.
Consequently, the type of a variable is of great importance to the
compiler.  If you fail to declare a variable, or declare it to be
the wrong type, you will see a compilation error.

@node Reserved words and example, Operating systems, Introduction, Top
@chapter Reserved words and an example

@cindex Reserved words
@cindex Libraries
C programs are constructed from a set of reserved words which provide
control and from libraries which perform special functions.  The basic
instructions are built up using a reserved set of words, such as
@samp{main}, @samp{for}, @samp{if},@samp{while}, @samp{default},
@samp{double}, @samp{extern}, @samp{for}, and @samp{int}, to name just a
few.  These words may not be used in just any old way: C demands that
they are used only for giving commands or making statements.  You cannot
use @samp{default}, for example, as the name of a variable.  An attempt
to do so will result in a compilation error.

@xref{reserved words list, , All the Reserved Words}, for a complete list
of the reserved words.

Words used in included libraries are also, effectively, reserved. If you
use a word which has already been adopted in a library, there will be a
conflict between your choice and the library.

Libraries provide @emph{frequently used functionality} and, in practice,
at least one library must be included in every program: the so-called C
library, of standard functions.  For example, the @file{stdio} library,
which is part of the C library, provides standard facilities for input
to and output from a program.

In fact, most of the facilities which C offers are provided as libraries
that are included in programs as plug-in expansion units.  While the
features provided by libraries are not strictly a part of the C language
itself, they are essential and you will never find a version of C
without them.  After a library has been included in a program, its
functions are defined and you cannot use their names.

@cindex Printing
@cindex Formatting text and variables
@cindex Output, formatting
     One invaluable function provided by the standard input/output
library is called @code{printf} or `print-formatted'.  It provides an
superbly versatile way of printing text.  The simplest way to use it is
to print out a literal string:

@smallexample
printf ("... some string ...");
@end smallexample

@noindent
Text is easy, but we also want to be able to print out the contents of
variables.  These can be inserted into a text string by using a `control
sequence' inside the quotes and listing the variables after the string
which get inserted into the string in place of the @emph{control
sequence}.  To print out an integer, the control sequence @code{%d} is used:

@smallexample
printf ("Integer = %d",someinteger);
@end smallexample

@noindent
The variable @code{someinteger} is printed instead of @samp{%d}.  The
@code{printf} function is described in full detail in the relevant
chapter, but we'll need it in many places before that.  The example
program below is a complete program.   If you are reading this in Info,
you can copy this to a file, compile and execute it.

@cindex Operating system
The basic control of a computer rests with its operating system. This is
a layer of software which drives the hardware and provides users with a
comfortable environment in which to work. An operating system has two
main components which are of interest to users: a @emph{user interface}
(often a command language) and a @emph{filing system}. The operating
system is the route to all input and output, whether it be to a screen
or to files on a disk. A programming language has to get at this input
and output easily so that programs can send out and receive messages
from the user and it has to be in contact with the operating system in
order to do this. In C the link between these two is very efficient.

@cindex Shell
Operating systems vary widely but most have a command language or
@emph{shell} which can be used to type in commands.  Recently the tendency
has been to try to eliminate typing completely by providing graphical
user interfaces (GUIs) for every purpose. GUIs are good for carrying out
simple procedures like editing, but they are not well suited to giving
complicated instructions to a computer. For that one needs a command
language. In the network version of this book we shall concentrate on
Unix shell commands since they are the most important to programmers.
On microcomputers command languages are usually very similar in concept,
though more primitive, with only slightly different words for
essentially the same commands. (This is a slightly superficial view).

@cindex Mainframe
When most compiler languages were developed, they were intended to be
run on large mainframe computers which operated on a multi-user,
time-sharing principle and were incapable of interactive communication
with the user. Many compiler languages still have this inadequacy when
carried over to modern computers, but C is an exception, because of its
unique design. Input and output are not actually defined as a fixed,
unchanging part of the C language. Instead there is a standard file
which has to be included in programs and defines the input/output
commands that are supported by the language for a particular computer
and operating system. This file is called a standard C library. (See the
next chapter for more information.) The library is standard in the sense
that C has developed a set of functions which all computers and
operating systems must implement, but which are specially adapted to
your system.

The filing system is also a part of input/output. In many operating
systems all routes in and out of the computer are treated by the
operating system as though they were files or data @emph{streams} (even
the keyboard!). C does this implicitly (it comes from Unix). The file
from which C normally gets its input from is called @emph{stdin} or
standard input file and it is usually the keyboard. The corresponding
route for output is called "stdout" or standard output file and is
usually a monitor screen. Both of these are parts of @emph{stdio} or
@emph{standard input output}. The keyboard and the monitor screen are
not really files, of course, they are `devices', (it is not possible to
re-read what has been sent to the monitor", or write to the keyboard.),
but devices are represented by files with special names, so that the
keyboard is treated as a read-only file, the monitor as a write only
file and so on. The advantage of treating devices like this is that it is not
necessary to know how a particular device works, only that it exists
somewhere, connected to the computer, and can be written to or read
from. In other words, it is exactly the same to read or write from a
device as it is to read or write from a file. This is a great
simplification of input/output! The filenames of devices (often given
the lofty title `pseudo device names') depend upon your particular
operating system. For instance, the printer might be called "PRN" or
"PRT". You might have to open it explicitly as a file.  When input is
taken solely from the keyboard and output is always to the screen then
these details can just be forgotten.

@node Filenames, Command languages, Files devices, Operating systems
@section Filenames

The compiler uses a special convention for the file names, so that we do
not confuse their contents.
The name of a source program (the code which you write) is
@file{@var{filename}.c}. The compiler generates a file of object code from
this called @file{@var{filename}.o}, as yet unlinked. The final program,
when linked to libraries is called @file{@var{filename}} on Unix-like
operating systems, and @file{@var{filename}.EXE} on Windows derived
systems. The libraries themselves are also files of object code, typically
called @file{lib@var{libraryname}.a} or @file{lib@var{libraryname}.so}.
Header files are always called @file{@var{libname}.h}.

@cindex File extensions
The endings `dot something' (called file extensions) identify the
contents of files for the compiler. The dotted endings mean that the
compiler can generate an executable file with the same name as the
original source -- just a different ending. The quad file and the object
file are only working files and should be deleted by the compiler at the
end of compilation. The @file{.c} suffix is to tell the compiler that
the file contains a C source program and similarly the other letters
indicate non-source files in a convenient way.  To execute the compiler
you type,
@smallexample
                     cc @var{filename}

@end smallexample
For example,
@smallexample
                     cc foo.c
@end smallexample

@noindent

@node Command languages, Questions 3, Filenames, Operating systems
@section Command Languages and Consoles

In order to do anything with a compiler or an editor you need to know a
little about the command language of the operating system. This means
the instructions which can be given to the system itself rather than the
words which make up a C program. e.g.

@smallexample

 ls -l

 less @var{filename}

 emacs @var{filename}

@end smallexample

@noindent
 In a large operating system (or even a relatively small one) it can be
a major feat of recollection to know all of the commands. Fortunately it
is possible to get by with knowing just handful of the most common ones
and having the system manual around to leaf through when necessary.

Another important object is the `panic button' or program interruption key. Every
system will have its own way of halting or terminating the operation of
a program or the execution of a command. Commonly this will involve two
simultaneous key presses, such as @kbd{CTRL C}, @kbd{CTRL Z} or
@kbd{CTRL-D} etc. In GNU/Linux, @kbd{CTRL-C} is used.

@chapter Libraries

@sp 1
@emph{Plug-in C expansions. Header files.}
@sp 1

The core of the C language is small and simple. Special functionality 
is provided in the form of libraries of ready-made functions.
This is what makes C so portable. Some libraries are provided for you, giving
you access to many special abilities without needing to reinvent the wheel.
You can also make your own, but to do so you need to know how your
operating system builds libraries. We shall return to this later.

@cindex Libraries of functions
Libraries are files of ready-compiled code which we can merge with a C
program at compilation time. Each library comes with a number of
associated @emph{header files} which make the functions easier to use.
For example, there are libraries of mathematical functions, string
handling functions and input/output functions and graphics libraries. It
is up to every programmer to make sure that libraries are added at
compilation time by typing an optional string to the compiler. For
example, to merge with the math library @file{libm.a} you would type
@smallexample

 cc -o @var{program_name} prog.c -lm

@end smallexample
@noindent
when you compile the program.
The @samp{-lm} means: add in @samp{libm}. If we wanted to add in the socket
library @file{libsocket.a} to do some network programming as well, we
would type
@smallexample

 cc -o @var{program_name} prog.c -lm -lsocket

@end smallexample
@noindent
and so on.
 
Why are these libraries not just included automatically?  Because it would
be a waste for the compiler to add on lots of code for maths functions,
say, if they weren't needed. When library functions are used in
programs, the appropriate library code is included by the compiler,
making the resulting object code often much longer.

Libraries are supplemented by header files which define @emph{macros},
@emph{data types} and @emph{external data} to be used in conjunction
with the libraries.  Once a header file has been included, it has
effectively added to the list of reserved words and commands in the
language. You cannot then use the names of functions or macros
which have already been defined in libraries or header files to mean
anything other than what the library specifies.

The most commonly used header file is the standard input/output library
which is called @file{stdio.h}. This belongs to a subset of the standard
C library which deals with file handling. The @file{math.h} header file
belongs to the mathematics library @file{libm.a}.  Header files for
libraries are included by adding to the source code:
@cindex Header files
@cindex stdio.h

@smallexample

#include @var{header}.h

@end smallexample
@noindent
at the top of a program file. For instance:
@smallexample

#include "myheader.h"

@end smallexample
@noindent
includes a personal header file which is in the current directory. Or
@smallexample

#include <stdio.h>

@end smallexample
@noindent
includes a file which lies in a standard directory like @file{/usr/include}.

The @code{#include} directive is actually a command to the C
preprocessor, which is dealt with more fully later, @xref{Preprocessor}.

Some functions can be used without having to include library files or special
libraries explicitly since every program is always merged with the
standard @emph{C library}, which is called @samp{libc}.

@smallexample

#include <stdio.h>

main ()

@{
printf ("C standard I/O file is included\n");
printf ("Hello world!");
@}

@end smallexample

@noindent
A program wishing to use a mathematical function such as @code{cos}
would need to include a mathematics library header file.

@smallexample

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

main ()

@{ double x,y;

y = sin (x);
printf ("Maths library ready");
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent

A particular operating system might require its own special
library for certain operations such as using a mouse or for opening
windows in a GUI environment, for example. These details will be
found in the local manual for a particular C compiler or operating
system.

Although there is no limit, in principle, to the number of libraries
which can be included in a program, there may be a practical limit:
namely memory, since every library adds to the size of both source and
object code. Libraries also add to the time it takes to compile a
program. Some operating systems are smarter than others when running
programs and can load in only what they need of the large
libraries. Others have to load in everything before they can run a
program at all, so many libraries would slow them down.

To know what names libraries have in a
particular operating system you have to search through its
documentation. Unix users are lucky in having an online
manual which is better than most written ones.

@sp 1

@cindex Style
@cindex Layout
C is actually a free format language. This means that there are
no rules about how it must be typed, when to start new lines, where to
place brackets or whatever. This has both advantages and dangers. The
advantage is that the user is free to choose a style which best suits
him or her and there is freedom in the way in which a program can be
structured. The disadvantage is that, unless a strict style is
adopted, very sloppy programs can be the result. The reasons for
choosing a well structured style are that:

@itemize @bullet

@item Long programs are @emph{manageable} only if programs are
   properly organized.

@item Programs are only @emph{understandable} if care is taken in
   choosing the names of variables and functions.

@item It is much easier to find parts of a program if a strict
   ordering convention is maintained. Such a scheme becomes
increasingly difficult to achieve with the size and complexity
of the problem.
@end itemize

No simple set of rules can ever provide the ultimate solution to writing
good programs. In the end, experience and good judgement are the factors
which decide whether a program is written well or poorly written. The
main goal of any style is to achieve @emph{clarity}.  Previously
restrictions of memory size, power and of particular compilers often
forced restrictions upon style, making programs cluttered and
difficult. All computers today are equipped with more than enough memory
for their purposes, and have very good optimizers which can produce
faster code than most programmers could write themselves without help,
so there are few good reasons not to make programs as clear as possible.

@chapter The form of a C program

@sp 1
@emph{What goes into a C program? What will it look like?}
@sp 1

@cindex Structure of a C program
C is made up entirely of building blocks which have a particular `shape'
or form. The form is the same everywhere in a program, whether it is the
form of the main program or of a subroutine. A program is made up of
functions, functions are made up of statements and declarations
surrounded by curly braces @code{@{ @}}.


The basic building block in a C program is the @emph{function}. Every C
program is a collection of one or more functions, written in some
arbitrary order. One and only one of these functions in the program must
have the name @code{main()}. This function is always the starting point of a C
program, so the simplest C program would be just a single function
definition:

@smallexample

main ()

@{
@}

@end smallexample

@noindent
The parentheses @samp{()} which follow the name of the function must be
included even though they apparently serve no purpose at this
stage. This is how C distinguishes functions from ordinary variables.

@image{img/7.1,12cm}

The function @code{main()} does not have to be at the top of a program
so a C program does not necessarily start at line 1. It always starts
where main() is.  Also, the function @code{main()} cannot be called from
any other function in the program. Only the operating system can call
the function @code{main()}: this is how a C program is started.
@cindex main function

The next most simple C program is perhaps a program which calls a
function @code{do_nothing} and then ends.

@smallexample

/******************************************************/
/*                                                    */
/* Program : do nothing                               */
/*                                                    */
/******************************************************/

main()                          /* Main program */

@{
do_nothing();
@}

/******************************************************/

do_nothing()                 /* Function called */

@{
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The program now consists of two functions, one of which is called by the
other. There are several new things to notice about this
program. Firstly the function @code{do_nothing()} is called by typing
its name followed by the characteristic @samp{()} brackets and a
semi-colon. This is all that is required to transfer control to the new
function. In some languages, words like CALL or PROC are used, or even
a symbol like @samp{&}. No such thing is needed in C.
The semi-colon is vital however. All instructions in C must end with a
semi-colon. This is a signal to inform the compiler that the end of a
statement has been reached and that anything which follows is meant to
be a part of another statement. This helps the compiler diagnose errors.
@cindex Braces
@cindex Curly braces

The `brace' characters @samp{@{} and @samp{@}} mark out a @emph{block}
into which instructions are written.  When the program meets the closing
brace @samp{@}} it then transfers back to @code{main()} where it meets
another @samp{@}} brace and the program ends. This is the simplest way
in which control flows between functions in C.  All functions have the
same status as far as a program is concerned. The function @code{main()}
is treated just as any other function. When a program is compiled, each
function is compiled as a separate entity and then at the end the linker
phase in the compiler attempts to sew them all together.

The examples above are obviously very simple but they illustrate
how control flows in a C program. Here are some more basic elements
which we shall cover.

@cindex Comments
@cindex Whiet space
Comments are a way of inserting remarks and reminders into a program
without affecting its content.  Comments do not have a fixed place in a
program: the compiler treats them as though they were @emph{white space}
or blank characters and they are consequently ignored. Programs can
contain any number of comments without losing speed. This is because
comments are stripped out of a source program by the compiler when it
converts the source program into machine code.

Comments are marked out or @emph{delimited} by the following pairs of
characters:

@smallexample

/* ... comment ... */

@end smallexample

Because a comment is skipped over as though it were a single
space, it can be placed anywhere where spaces are valid characters,
even in the middle of a statement, though this is not to be
encouraged. You should try to minimize the use of comments in
a program while trying to maximize the readability of the program.
If there are too many comments you obscure your code and it is the
code which is the main message in a program.

@sp 1

@cindex Functions
@cindex Black boxes
A function is a module or block of program code which deals with a
particular task. Making functions is a way of isolating one block of
code from other independent blocks of code.  Functions serve two
purposes. They allow a programmer to say: `this piece of code does a
specific job which stands by itself and should not be mixed up with
anything else', and they make a block of code @emph{reusable} since a
function can be reused in many different contexts without repeating
parts of the program text.

Functions help us to organize a program in a simple way; in Kernighan
& Ritchie C they are always
written in the following form:

@smallexample

@var{identifier} (@var{parameter1}, @var{parameter2}, ...)

@var{types of parameters}

@{ @var{variable declarations}

@var{statements} ...

@}
@end smallexample
For example
@smallexample
Pythagoras(x,y,z)

double x,y,z;

@{ double d;

d = sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z);

printf("The distance to your point was %f\n",d);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
In the newer ANSI standard, the same function is written slightly differently:
@smallexample
Pythagoras(double x, double y, double z)

@{ double d;

d = sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z);

printf("The distance to your point was %f\n",d);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
You will probably see both styles in C programs.

Each function has a name or identifier which is used to refer to it
in a program. A function can accept a number of @emph{parameters} or values
which pass information from outside, and consists of a number
of statements and declarations, enclosed by curly braces @code{@{ @}}, which
make up the doing part of the object. The declarations and `type of
parameter' statements are formalities which will be described in good
time.

@cindex Function names
@cindex Identifier names
@cindex Names, for identifiers
The name of a function in C can be anything from a single letter to a
long word. The name of a function must begin with an alphabetic letter
or the underscore @samp{_} character but the other characters in the
name can be chosen from the following groups:

@table @code
@item a-z  
(any letter from a to z)
@item A-Z  
(any letter from A to Z)
@item 0-9  
(any digit from 0 to 9)
@item  _       
(the underscore character)
@end table

@noindent
This means that sensible names can easily be chosen for functions
making a program easy to read.  Here is a real example function which adds
together two integer numbers @code{a} and @code{b} and prints the result
@code{c}. All the variables are chosen to be integers to keep things
simple and the result is printed out using the print-formatted function
printf, from the standard library, with a @code{"%d"} to indicate that it
is printing a integer.

@smallexample

Add_Two_Numbers (a,b)               /* Add a and b */

int a,b;

@{ int c;

c = a + b;
printf ("%d",c);

@}

@end smallexample

@noindent
Notice the position of the function name and where braces and
semi-colons are placed: they are crucial. The details are quickly
learned with practice and experience.

@cindex Calling functions
This function is not much use standing alone. It has to be called
from somewhere. A function is @emph{called}
(i.e. control is passed to the function) by using its name with
the usual brackets () to follow it, along with the values which are to
be passed to the function:

@smallexample

main ()

@{ int c,d;

c = 1;
d = 53;

Add_Two_Numbers (c,d);
Add_Two_Numbers (1,2);

@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The result of this program would be to print out the number 54 and
then the number 3 and then stop. Here is a simple program which makes
use of some functions in a playful way. The structure diagram shows
how this can be visualized and the significance of the program
`levels'. The idea is to illustrate the way in which the functions connect
together:

@section Functions with values

@cindex Functions with values
In other languages and in mathematics a function is understood to
be something which produces a value or a number. 
That is, the whole function is thought of as having a value. In
C it is possible to choose whether or not a function will have a
value. It is possible to make a function hand back a value to the
place at which it was called. Take the following example:

@smallexample

bill = CalculateBill(data ...);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The variable @code{bill} is assigned to a function
@code{CalculateBill()} and @code{data} are some data which are passed to
the function. This statement makes it look as though
@code{CalculateBill()} is a number. When this statement is executed in a
program, control will be passed to the function @code{CalculateBill()}
and, when it is done, this function will then hand control back. The
value of the function is assigned to "bill" and the program continues.
Functions which work in this way are said to @emph{return} a value.

In C, returning a value is a simple matter. 
Consider the function CalculateBill() from the
statement above:

@smallexample

CalculateBill(starter,main,dessert)   /* Adds up values */

int starter,main,dessert;

@{ int total;

total = starter + main + dessert;
return (total);
@}

@end smallexample

@noindent
As soon as the @code{return} statement is met @code{CalculateBill()} stops
executing and assigns the value @code{total} to the function. If there were
no @code{return} statement the program could not know which value it should
associate with the name @code{CalculateBill} and so it would not be
meaningful to speak of the function as having one value. Forgetting a
@code{return} statement can ruin a program. For instance if @code{CalculateBill}
had just been:

@smallexample

CalculateBill (starter,main,dessert)  /* WRONG! */

int starter,main,dessert;

@{ int total;

total = starter + main + dessert;
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
@cindex Expressions
then the value @code{bill} would just be garbage (no predictable value),
presuming that the compiler allowed this to be written at all. On the
other hand if the first version were used (the one which did use the
@code{return(total)} statement) and furthermore no assignment were made:

@smallexample

main ()

@{
CalculateBill (1,2,3);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
then the value of the function would just be discarded, quite
legitimately. This is usually what is done with the input output
functions @code{printf()} and @code{scanf()} which actually return
values. So a function in C can return a value but it does not have to be
used; on the other hand, a value which has not been returned cannot be
used safely.
@cindex Returning values

@emph{Note: Functions do not have to return integers: you can decide whether
they should return a different data type, or even no value at all. (See next chapter)}

@node Breaking out early, The exit function, Functions with values, Functions
@section Breaking out early

Suppose that a program is in the middle of some awkward process
in a function which is not @code{main()}, perhaps two or three loops working
together, for example, and suddenly the function finds its
answer. This is where the beauty of the @code{return} statement becomes
clear. The program can simply call @code{return(value)} anywhere in the
function and control will jump out of any number of loops or whatever
and pass the value back to the calling statement without having to
finish the function up to the closing brace @code{@}}.

@smallexample

myfunction (a,b)     /* breaking out of functions early */

int a,b;

@{
while (a < b)
   @{
   if (a > b)
      @{
      return (b);
      @}
   a = a + 1;
   @}
@}

@end smallexample

@noindent
The example shows this. The function is entered with some values for
@code{a} and @code{b} and, assuming that @code{a} is less than @code{b},
it starts to execute one of C's loops called @code{while}. In that loop,
is a single @code{if} statement and a statement which increases a by one
on each loop. If a becomes bigger than @code{b} at any point the
@code{return(b)} statement gets executed and the function
@code{myfunction} quits, without having to arrive at the end brace
@samp{@}}, and passes the value of @code{b} back to the place it was
called.

@node The exit function, Functions and types, Breaking out early, Functions
@section The @code{exit()} function

The function called @code{exit()} can be used to terminate a program at
any point, no matter how many levels of function calls have been
made. This is called with a return code, like this:

@smallexample
#define CODE  0

exit (CODE);
@end smallexample
@cindex exit function
@cindex Terminating a program

@noindent
This function also calls a number of other functions which perform
tidy-up duties such as closing open files etc. 

@node Functions and types, Questions 8, The exit function, Functions
@section Functions and Types

All the variables and values used up to now have been
integers. But what happens if a function is required to return a
different kind of value such as a character? A statement like:

@smallexample

bill = CalculateBill (a,b,c);

@end smallexample
@noindent
can only make sense if the variable @code{bill} and the value of the
function @code{CalculateBill()} are the same kind of object: in other
words if @code{CalculateBill()} returns a floating point number, then
@code{bill} cannot be a character! Both sides of an assignment must
match.

In fact this is done by declaring functions to return a particular
type of data. So far no declarations have been needed because C assumes that
all values are integers unless you specifically choose something
different. Declarations are covered in the next chapter.

@cindex Variables
@cindex Variable names
A variable is a sequence of program code with a name (also called its
@emph{identifier}).  A name or identifier in C can be anything from a
single letter to a word. The name of a variable must begin with an
alphabetic letter or the underscore @samp{_} character but the other
characters in the name can be chosen from the following groups:

@table @code
@item a-z  
(any letter from a to z)
@item A-Z  
(any letter from A to Z)
@item 0-9  
(any digit from 0 to 9)
@item _       
(the underscore character)
@end table
@noindent
Some examples of valid variable names are:

@smallexample

 a  total  Out_of_Memory  VAR  integer  ...

@end smallexample

In C variables do not only have names: they also have types.  The
@emph{type} of a variable conveys to the compiler what sort of data
will be stored in it. In BASIC and in some older, largely obsolete
languages, like PL/1, a special naming convention is used to determine
the sort of data which can be held in particular variables. e.g. the
dollar symbol @samp{$} is commonly used in BASIC to mean that a variable is a
string and the percentage @samp{%} symbol is used to indicate an integer. No
such convention exists in C. Instead we specify the types
of variables in their declarations. This serves two purposes:

@itemize @bullet
@item It gives a compiler precise information about the
amount of memory that will have to be given over to a
   variable when a program is finally run and what sort
   of arithmetic will have to be used on it (e.g.
   integer only or floating point or none).

@item It provides the compiler with a list of the variables
   in a convenient place so that it can cross check names
   and types for any errors.

@end itemize

There is a lot of different possible types in C. In fact it is possible
for us to define our own, but there is no
need to do this right away: there are some basic types which are
provided by C ready for use. The names of these types are all reserved
words in C and they are summarized as follows:
@cindex Integer types
@cindex char
@cindex short
@cindex int
@cindex long

@table @code
@item char
      A single ASCII character
@item short
     A short integer (usually 16-bits)
@item short int
 A short integer
@item int
      A standard integer (usually 32-bits)
@item long
      A long integer
@item long int
  A long integer (usually 32-bits, but increasingly 64 bits)

@item float
     A floating point or real number (short)
@item long float
a long floating point number
@item double
    A long floating point number

@item  void
Discussed in a later chapter.
@item enum        
Discussed in a later chapter.
@item volatile
Discussed in a later chapter.

@end table
@noindent
There is some repetition in these words. In
addition to the above, the word @code{unsigned} can also be placed in
front of any of these types. Unsigned means that only positive or zero
values can be used. (i.e. there is no minus sign). The advantage of
using this kind of variable is that storing a minus sign takes up some
memory, so that if no minus sign is present, larger numbers can be
stored in the same kind of variable. The ANSI standard also
allows the word @code{signed} to be placed in front of any of these types,
so indicate the opposite of unsigned. On some systems variables are signed
by default, whereas on others they are not.

@section Declarations

@cindex Variables, declaring
To declare a variable in a C program one writes
the @emph{type} followed by a list of variable @emph{names} which are
to be treated as being that type:

@smallexample
  typename @var{variablename1}, ..., @var{variablenameN};

@end smallexample
@noindent
For example:
@smallexample

  int i,j;
  char ch;
  double x,y,z,fred;
  unsigned long int Name_of_Variable;

@end smallexample
Failing to declare a variable is more risky than passing through
customs and failing to declare your six tonnes of Swiss chocolate. A compiler is
markedly more efficient than a customs officer: it will catch a
missing declaration every time and will terminate a compiling session
whilst complaining bitterly, often with a host of messages, one for
each use of the undeclared variable.

@node Where to declare things, Declarations and Initialization, Declarations, Variables
@section Where to declare things

@cindex Local variables
@cindex Scope
There are two kinds of place in which declarations can be
made, @xref{Scope}. For now it will do to simply state
what these places are.

@enumerate
@item 
One place is outside all of the functions. That is, in
the space between function definitions.  (After the
@code{#include} lines, for example.)  Variables declared
here are called global variables.  They are also called
static and external variables in special
cases.)

@smallexample

#include <stdio.h>

int globalinteger;              /* Here! outside @{@} */

float global_floating_point;

main ()

@{
@}

@end smallexample

@item 
The other place where declarations can be made is
   following the opening brace, @{@}, of a block.  Any block
   will do, as long as the declaration follows immediately
   after the opening brace.  Variables of this kind only
   work inside their braces @{@} and are often called local
   variables. Another name for them is automatic variables.

@smallexample

 main ()

 @{ int a;
   float x,y,z;

 /* statements */

@end smallexample

@smallexample

@node Declarations and Initialization, Types, Where to declare things, Variables
@section Declarations and Initialization

@cindex Initializing variables
@cindex Variables, initializing
When a variable is declared in C, the language allows a neat
piece of syntax which means that variables can be declared and
assigned a value in one go. This is no more efficient than doing it in
two stages, but it is sometimes tidier. The following:

@smallexample

int i = 0;

char ch = 'a';

@end smallexample
@noindent
are equivalent to the more longwinded

@smallexample

int i;
char ch;

i = 0;
ch = 'a';

@end smallexample
@noindent
This is called @emph{initialization} of the variables. C always allows
the programmer to write declarations/initializers in this way, but it is
not always desirable to do so. If there are just one or two declarations
then this initialization method can make a program neat and tidy. If
there are many, then it is better to initialize separately, as in the
second case. A lot means when it starts to look as though there are too
many. It makes no odds to the compiler, nor (ideally) to the final code
whether the first or second method is used. It is only for tidiness that
this is allowed.

@node char, Example special characters, Types, Types
@subsection @code{char}

A character type is a variable which can store a single ASCII
character. Groups of @code{char} form strings.
In C single characters are written enclosed by single
quotes, e.g. @code{'c'}! (This is in contrast to strings of many characters which use
double quotes, e.g. @code{"string"}) For instance, if @code{ch} is the name
of a character:

@smallexample

char ch;

ch = 'a';

@end smallexample
@noindent
would give @code{ch} the value of the character @code{a}. The same effect can also
be achieved by writing:

@smallexample

char ch = 'a';

@end smallexample
@noindent
A character can be any ASCII character, printable or not printable
from values -128 to 127. (But only 0 to 127 are used.) Control
characters i.e. non printable characters are put into programs by
using a backslash @code{\} and a special character or number. The characters
and their meanings are:
@cindex Special characters
@cindex Non-printable characters
@cindex Control characters

@node integers, Float, Example special characters, Types
@subsection Integers

@cindex Integers
@section Whole numbers
There are five integer types in C and they are called @code{char}, @code{int},
@code{long}, @code{long long} and @code{short}.  The difference between these is the size
of the integer which either can hold and the amount of storage required
for them.  The sizes of these objects depend on the operating system of
the computer.  Even different flavours of Unix can have varying sizes for
these objects.  Usually, the two to remember are @code{int} and
@code{short}.  @code{int} means a `normal' integer and @code{short} means
a `short' one, not that that tells us much.  On a typical 32 bit
microcomputer the size of these integers is the following:
@cindex short
@cindex int
@cindex long

@smallexample
Type           Bits      Possible Values

short          16        -32768 to 32767
unsigned short 16        0 to 65535

int            32        -2147483648 to 2147483647
long           32                 (ditto)
unsigned int   32        0 to 4294967295
long long      64        -9e18 to + 8e18

@end smallexample
@noindent
Increasingly though, 64 bit operating systems are appearing and long
integers are 64 bits long. You should always check these values. Some
mainframe operating systems are completely 64 bit, e.g. Unicos has no
32 bit values.
Variables are declared in the usual way:

@smallexample

int i,j;

i = j = 0;

@end smallexample
or
@smallexample

short i=0,j=0;

@end smallexample

@node Float,  , integers, Types
@subsection Floating Point

There are also long and short floating point numbers in C. 
All the mathematical functions which C can use require
@code{double} or @code{long float} arguments so it is common to use the type
float for storage only of small floating point numbers and to use
double elsewhere. (This is not always true since the C `cast' operator
allows temporary conversions to be made.) On a typical 32 bit
implementation the different types would be organized as follows:

@smallexample

Type           Bits      Possible Values

float          32        +/- 10E-37 to +/- 10E38
double         64        +/- 10E-307 to +/- 10E308
long float     32                (ditto)
long double    ???

@end smallexample
@noindent
Typical declarations:

@smallexample

float x,y,z;
x = 0.1;
y = 2.456E5
z = 0;

double bignum,smallnum;
bignum = 2.36E208;
smallnum = 3.2E-300;

@end smallexample

@node Choosing Variables, Assigning variables to one another, Types, Variables
@section Choosing Variables

The sort of procedure that you would adopt when choosing variable names
is something like the following:

@itemize @bullet

@item Decide what a variable is for and what type it needs to
   be.
@item Choose a sensible name for the variable.
@item Decide where the variable is allowed to exist.
@item Declare that name to be a variable of the chosen type.
@end itemize

@cindex Loop variables
Some local variables are only used temporarily, for controlling
loops for instance. It is common to give these short names (single
characters). A good habit to adopt is to keep to a consistent practice
when using these variables. A common one, for instance is to use the
letters:

@smallexample

int i,j,k;

@end smallexample
@noindent
to be integer type variables used for counting. (There is no particular
reason why this should be; it is just common practice.) Other integer
values should have more meaningful names.  Similarly names like:

@smallexample

double x,y,z;

@end smallexample
@noindent
tend to make one think of floating point numbers.

@node  Assigning variables to one another, Types and The Cast Operator, Choosing Variables, Variables
@section Assigning variables to one another

Variables can be assigned to numbers:

@smallexample

var = 10;

@end smallexample
@noindent
and assigned to each other:
@smallexample

var1 = var2;

@end smallexample
@noindent
In either case the objects on either side of the @code{=} symbol must be of
the same type. It is possible (though not usually sensible) to assign a
floating point number to a character for instance. So

@smallexample

int a, b = 1;

a = b;

@end smallexample
@noindent
is a valid statement, and:

@smallexample

float x = 1.4;
char ch;

ch = x;

@end smallexample
@noindent
is a valid statement, since the truncated value 1 can be assigned to
@code{ch}.  This is a questionable practice though. It is unclear why
anyone would choose to do this.  Numerical values and characters will
interconvert because characters are stored by their ASCII codes (which
are integers!) Thus the following will work:

@smallexample

int i;
char ch = 'A';

i = ch;

printf ("The ASCII code of %c is %d",ch,i);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The result of this would be:

@smallexample

 The ASCII code of A is 65

@section Types and The Cast Operator

@cindex Types
@cindex Variable types
@cindex cast operator
It is worth mentioning briefly a very valuable operator in C: it
is called the cast operator and its function is to convert one type of
value into another. For instance it would convert a character into an
integer:

@smallexample

int i;
char ch = '\n';

i = (int) ch;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The value of the integer would be the ASCII code of the
character. This is the only integer which it would make any sense to
talk about in connection with the character. Similarly floating point
and integer types can be interconverted:
@cindex Type conversion

@smallexample

float x = 3.3;
int i;

i = (int) x;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The value of @code{i} would be 3 because an integer cannot represent decimal
points, so the cast operator rounds the number. There is no such
problem the other way around.

@image{img/10.1,12cm}

@smallexample

float x;
int i = 12;

x = (float) i;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The general form of the cast operator is therefore:

@smallexample

               (@var{type}) @var{variable}

@end smallexample
@noindent
It does not always make sense to convert types. This will be seen
particularly with regard to structures and unions. Cast operators crop
up in many areas of C. This is not the last time they will have to be
explained.

@section Storage class @code{static} and @code{extern}

Sometimes C programs are written in more than one text file.  If
this is the case then, on occasion, it will be necessary to get at
variables which were defined in another file. If the word extern is
placed in front of a variable then it can be referenced across files:
@cindex Extern class

@smallexample

     @var{File 1}                        @var{File 2}

                                 int i;

   main ()                       function ()

   @{                            @{
   extern int i;                 
   @}                            @}


@end smallexample
@noindent
In this example, the function @code{main()} in file 1 can use the
variable @code{i} from the function@code{ main()} in file 2.

@cindex Static variables
Another class is called @code{static}. The name @code{static} is given to
variables which can hold their values between calls of a function:
they are allocated once and once only and their values are preserved
between any number of function calls. Space is allocated for static
variables in the program code itself and it is never disposed of
unless the whole program is. NOTE: Every global variable, defined
outside functions has the type static automatically. The opposite of
static is @code{auto}.

@section Functions, Types and Declarations

Functions do not always have to return values which are integers
despite the fact that this has been exclusively the case up to
now. Unless something special is done to force a function to return a
different kind of value C will always assume that the type of a
function is @code{int}.

If you want this to be different, then a function has
to be declared to be a certain type, just as variables have to
be. There are two places where this must be done:

@itemize @bullet
@item 
The name of the function must be declared a certain type
   where the function is declared. e.g. a function which
   returns a float value must be declared as:

@smallexample

     float function1 ()
   
     @{
     return (1.229);
     @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
A function which returns a character:
@smallexample

     char function2 ()

     @{
     return ('*');
     @}
@end smallexample

@item
 As well as declaring a function's identifier to be a
   certain type in the function definition, it must
   (irritatingly) be declared in the function in which it
   is called too! The reasons for this are related to the
   way in which C is compiled. So, if the two functions
   above were called from @code{main()}, they would have to
   be declared in the declaration section of that function:

@smallexample

     main ()

     @{ char ch, function2 ();
       float x, function1 ();

     x = function1 ();
     ch = function2 ();
     @}

@end smallexample
@noindent

If a function whose type is not integer is not declared like
this, then compilation errors will result! Notice also that the
function must be declared inside every function which calls it, not
just @code{main()}.

@cindex Parameters to functions
Not all functions will be as simple as the ones which have been given so
far.  Functions are most useful if they can be given information to work
with and if they can reach variables and data which are defined outside
of them. Examples of this have already been seen in a limited way. For
instance the function @code{CalculateBill} accepted three values
@code{a},@code{b} and @code{c}.

@smallexample

CalculateBill (a,b,c)

int a,b,c;

@{ int total;

total = a + b + c;
return total;
@}

@end smallexample

@noindent
When variable values are handed to a function, by writing them
inside a functions brackets like this, the function is said to accept
parameters. In mathematics a parameter is a variable which controls
the behaviour of something. In C it is a variable which carries some
special information. In @code{CalculateBill} the "behaviour" is the addition
process. In other words, the value of @code{total} depends upon the
starting values of @code{a},@code{b} and @code{c}.

Parameters are about communication between different functions in
a program. They are like messengers which pass information to and from
different places. They provide a way of getting information into a
function, but they can also be used to hand information back.
Parameters are usually split into two categories: @emph{value}
parameters and @emph{variable} parameters. Value parameters are one-way
communication carrying information into a function from somewhere
outside. Variable parameters are two-way.

A function was defined by code which looks like this:

@smallexample

@var{identifier} (@var{parameters} ...)

@var{types of parameters}

@{

@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Parameters, like variables and functions, also have types which
must be declared. For instance:

@smallexample

function1 (i,j,x,y)

int i,j;
float x,y;

@{

@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
or
@smallexample

char function2 (x,ch)

double x;
char ch;

@{ char ch2 = '*';

return (ch2);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice that they are declared outside the block braces.

@node Value parameters, Functions as actual parameters, Declaring parameters, Parameters
@section Value Parameters

@cindex Value parameters
A value parameter is the most common kind of parameter. All of
the examples up to now have been examples of value parameters.
When a value parameter is passed to a function its
value is copied to a new place which is completely isolated from the
place that the information came from. An example helps to show
this. Consider a function which is called from @code{main()} whose purpose is
to add together two numbers and to print out the result.

@smallexample

#include <stdio.h>

main ()

@{
add (1,4);
@}

  /*******************************************/

add (a,b)

int a,b;

@{
printf ("%d", a+b);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
When this program is run, two new variables are automatically created by
the language, called @code{a} and @code{b}. The value 1 is copied into a
and the value 4 is copied into @code{b}. Obviously if a and b were given
new values in the function @code{add()} then this could not change the
values 1 and 4 in @code{main()}, because 1 is always 1 and 4 is always
4. They are constants. However if instead the program had been:

@image{img/11.1,12cm}

@smallexample

main ()

@{ int a = 1, b = 4;

add (a,b);
@}

  /**************************************/


add (a,b)

int a,b;

@{
printf ("%d", a+b);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
then it is less clear what will happen.
In fact exactly the same thing happens:

@itemize @bullet
@item 
When @code{add()} is called from @code{main()} two new variables @code{a} and
   @code{b} are created by the language (which have nothing to do
   with the variables @code{a} and @code{b} in @code{main()} and are
completely isolated from them). 

@item  
The value of @code{a} in @code{main()} is copied into the value of @code{a} in
@code{add()}.

@item  
The value of @code{b} in @code{main()} is copied into the value of @code{b} in
@code{add()}.

@end itemize
@noindent
Now, any reference to @code{a} and @code{b} within the function
@code{add()} refers only to the two parameters of @code{add} and not to
the variables with the same names which appeared in @code{main()}. This means that if
@code{a} and @code{b} are altered in @code{add()} they will not affect
@code{a} and @code{b} in @code{main()}.  More advanced computing texts
have names for the old and the new @code{a} and @code{b}:

@table @emph
@item Actual Parameters 
These are the original values which
were handed over to a function. Another
name for this is an argument.

@item Formal Parameters 
These are the copies which work inside
the function which was called.

@end table

@noindent
Here are some points about value parameters.

@itemize @bullet
@item
  The names of formal parameters can be anything at all.
   They do not have to be the same as the actual parameters.
   So in the example above it would be equally valid to
   write:

@smallexample

#include <stdio.h>

main ()

@{ int a = 1, b = 4;

add (a,b);
@}

  /*******************************************/

add (i,j)

int i,j;

@{
printf ("%d", i+j);
@}

@end smallexample

    In this case the value of @code{a} in @code{main()} would be copied to
    the value of @code{i} in @code{add()} and the value of @code{b} in @code{main()}
    would be copied to the value of @code{j} in @code{add()}.

@item
  The parameters ought to match by data type when taken in an
    ordered sequence. It is possible to
    copy a floating point number into a character formal
    parameter, causing yourself problems which are hard to
diagnose. Some compilers will spot this if it is done
accidentally and will flag it as an error. e.g.

@smallexample

main ()

@{
function ('*',1.0);
@}

  /********************************/

function (ch,i)

char ch;
int i;

@{
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
   is probably wrong because 1.0 is a floating point value, not an
   integer.


@item 
 The parameters ought to, but need not
   match in number! This surprising fact is important
   because programs can go wrong if a formal parameter
   was missed out. ANSI C has a way of checking this by
function `prototyping', but in Kernighan & Ritchie C there
@cindex Prototyping
is no way to check this. If the number of actual parameters is
   more than the number of formal parameters and all of the
   parameters match in type then the extra values are just
   discarded. If the number of actual parameters is less
   than the number of formal parameters, then the compiler
   will assign some unknown value to the formal parameters.
   This will probably be garbage.

@item 
Our use of variables as parameters should not leave you with
the impression that we can only use variables as parameters.
In fact, we can send any literal value, or expression with an appropriate
type to a function. For example,
@smallexample
sin(3.41415);
cos(a+b*2.0);
strlen("The length of this string");
@end smallexample

@end itemize

@node Functions as actual parameters, Example 2, Value parameters, Parameters
@section Functions as actual parameters

The value returned by a function can be used directly as a value
parameter. It does not have to be assigned to a variable first. For
instance:

@smallexample

main ()

@{
PrintOut (SomeValue());
@}

  /*********************************************/

PrintOut (a)           /* Print the value */

int a;

@{
printf ("%d",a);
@}

  /**********************************************/

SomeValue ()     /* Return an arbitrary number */

@{
return (42);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This often gives a concise way of passing a value to a function.

until you have read about Pointers and Operators.)}

One way to hand information back is to use the @code{return} statement.
 This function is slightly limited however in
that it can only hand the value of one variable back at a time. There
is another way of handing back values which is less restrictive, but
more awkward than this. This is by using a special kind of parameter,
often called a variable parameter. It is most easily explained with
the aid of an example:

@image{img/11.2,12cm}

@smallexample

#include <stdio.h>

main ()

@{ int i,j;

GetValues (&i,&j);
printf ("i = %d and j = %d",i,j)
@}

   /************************************/

GetValues (p,q)

int *p,*q;

@{
*p = 10;
*q = 20;
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
To understand fully what is going on in this program requires a
knowledge of pointers and operators, which are covered in later
chapters, but a brief explanation can be given here, so that the
method can be used.

There are two new things to notice about this program: the
symbols @samp{&} and @samp{*}.
The ampersand @samp{&} symbol should be read as "the address of..".
The star @samp{*} symbol should be read as "the contents of the
address ...". This is easily confused with the multiplication symbol
(which is identical). The difference is only in the context in which
the symbol is used. Fortunately this is not ambiguous since
multiplication always takes place between two numbers or variables,
whereas the "contents of a pointer" applies only to a single variable
and the star precedes the variable name.

So, in the program above, it is not the variables themselves which are
being passed to the procedure but the addresses of  the variables. In
other words, information about where the variables are stored in the
memory is passed to the function @code{GetValues()}. These addresses are
copied into two new variables @code{p} and @code{q}, which are said to
be pointers to @code{i} and @code{j}. So, with variable parameters, the
function does not receive a copy of the variables themselves, but
information about how to get at the original variable which was
passed. This information can be used to alter the "actual parameters"
directly and this is done with the @samp{*} operator.

@smallexample

*p = 10;

@end smallexample
@noindent
means: Make the contents of the address held in @code{p} equal to
10. Recall that the address held in @code{p} is the address of the
variable @code{i}, so this actually reads: make @code{i} equal to
10. Similarly:

@smallexample

*q = 20;

@end smallexample
@noindent
means make the contents of the address held in @code{q} equal to 20. Other
operations are also possible (and these are detailed in the chapter on
pointers) such as finding out the value of @code{i} and putting it into a new
variable, say, @code{a}:

@smallexample

int a;

a = *p;   /* is equivalent to a = i */

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice that the * symbol is required in the declaration of these
parameters.

@cindex Scope
From the computer's point of view, a C program is nothing more than a
collection of functions and declarations.  Functions can be thought of
as sealed capsules of program code which float on a background of
@emph{white space},
and are connected together by means of function calls. 
White space is
the name given to the white of an imaginary piece of paper upon which a
program is written, in other words the spaces and new line characters
which are invisible to the eye. The global white space is only the gaps
between functions, not the gaps inside functions.  Thinking of functions
as sealed capsules is a useful way of understanding the difference
between local and global objects and the whole idea of @emph{scope} in a
program.
@cindex White space

Another analogy is to think of what goes on in a function as being like
watching a reality on television. You cannot go in and change the TV
reality, only observe the output, but the television show draws its
information from the world around it. You can send a parameter
(e.g. switch channels) to make some choices. A function called by a function,
is like seeing someone watching a televsion, in a television show.

@section Global Variables

@cindex Global variables
Global variables are declared in the white space between functions. If
every function is a ship floating in this sea of white space, then
global variables (data storage areas which also float in this sea) can
enter any ship and also enter anything inside any ship (See the
diagram). Global variables are available everywhere;.  they are created
when a program is started and are not destroyed until a program is
stopped. They can be used anywhere in a program: there is no restriction
about where they can be used, in principle.

@node Local variables, Parameters again, Global variables, Scope
@section Local Variables

@cindex Local variables
Local variables are more interesting. They can not enter just any
region of the program because they are trapped inside blocks. To use
the ship analogy: if it is imagined that on board every ship (which
means inside every function) there is a large swimming pool with many
toy ships floating inside, then local variables will work anywhere in
the swimming pool (inside any of the toys ships, but can not get out
of the large ship into the wide beyond. The swimming pool is just like
a smaller sea, but one which is restricted to being inside a
particular function. Every function has its own swimming pool! The
idea can be taken further too. What about swimming pools onboard the
toy ships? (Meaning functions or blocks inside the functions!

@smallexample

    /* Global white space "sea" */

function ()

@{
/* On board ship */

     @{
     /* On board a toy ship */
     @}
@}

@end smallexample

@image{img/12.1,12cm}

The same rules apply for the toy ships. Variables can reach anywhere
inside them but they cannot get out. They cannot escape their block
braces @{@}.
Whenever a pair of block braces is written into a program it is
possible to make variable declarations inside the opening brace. Like
this:

@smallexample

@{ int locali;
  char localch;

/* statements */

@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
These variables do not exist outside the braces. They are only
created when the opening brace is encountered and they are destroyed
when the closing brace is executed, or when control jumps out of the
block. Because they only work in this local area of a program, they
are called local variables. It is a matter of style and efficiency to
use local variables when it does not matter whether variables are
preserved outside of a particular block, because the system
automatically allocates and disposes of them. The programmer does not
have to think about this.

Where a variable is and is not defined is called the scope of
that variable. It tells a programmer what a variables horizons are!

@node Parameters again, Example 5, Local variables, Scope
@section Communication : parameters

If functions were sealed capsules and no local variables could
ever communicate with other parts of the program, then functions would
not be very useful. This is why parameters are allowed. Parameters are
a way of handing local variables to other functions without letting
them out! Value parameters (see previous chapter) make copies of local
variables without actually using them. The copied parameter is then a
local variable in another function. In other words, it can't get out
of the function to which it is passed ... unless it is passed on as
another parameter.

@node Example 5, Style note, Parameters again, Scope
@section Example Listing

Notice about the example that if there are two variables of the
same name, which are both allowed to be in the same place (@code{c} in the
example below) then the more local one wins. That is, the last
variable to be defined takes priority. (Technically adept readers will
realize that this is because it was the last one onto the variable
stack.)

@cindex Style, global variables
Some programmers complain about the use of global variables in a
program. One complaint is that it is difficult to see what information
is being passed to a function unless all that information is passed as
parameters. Sometimes global variables are very useful however, and this
problem need not be crippling. A way to make this clear is to write
global variables in capital letters only, while writing the rest of the
variables in mainly small letters ...

@smallexample

int GLOBALINTEGER;

...

@{ int local integer;

@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This allows global variables to be spotted easily. Another reason for
restricting the use of global variables is that it is easier to debug a
program if only local variables are used. The reason is that once a
function capsule is tested and sealed it can be guaranteed to work in
all cases, provided it is not affected by any other functions from
outside. Global variables punch holes in the sealed function capsules
because they allow bugs from other functions to creep into tried and
tested ones. An alert and careful programmer can usually control this
without difficulty.

The following guidelines may help the reader to decide whether to
use local or global data:

@itemize @bullet
@item
  Always think of using a local variable first. Is it
     impractical? Yes, if it means passing dozens of
     parameters to functions, or reproducing a lot of
     variables. Global variables will sometimes tidy up
     a program.

@item
 Local variables make the flow of data in
 a program clearer and they reduce the amount of
memory used by the program when they are not in use.

@item
 The preference in this book is to use local variables
     for all work, except where a program centres around
     a single data structure. If a data structure is the main
reason for a program's existence, it is nearly always defined globally.

@end itemize

@node Scope and style, Questions 11, Style note, Scope
@section Scope and Style

All the programs in this book, which are longer than a couple of
lines, are written in an unusual way: with a @emph{levelled structure}
There are several good reasons for this. One is that the
sealed capsules are shown to be sealed, by using a comment bar between
each function.

@smallexample

/**************************************/

@end smallexample
@noindent
Another good reason is that any function hands parameters down by only
one level at a time and that any @code{return()} statement hands values up a
single level. The global variables are kept to a single place at the
head of each program so that they can be seen to reach into
everything.

The diagram shows how the splitting of levels implies something
about the scope of variables and the handing of parameters.

@chapter Preprocessor Commands

@sp 1
@emph{Making programming versatile.}
@sp 1

@cindex Preprocessor
C is unusual in that it has a @emph{pre-processor}. This comes from its
Unix origins.  As its name might suggest, the preprocessor is a phase
which occurs prior to compilation of a program. The preprocessor has two
main uses: it allows external files, such as header files, to be
included and it allows @code{macros} to be defined. This useful feature
traditionally allowed constant values to be defined in Kernighan and
Ritchie C, which had no constants in the language.

Pre-processor commands are distinguished by the hash (number) symbol
@samp{#}. One example of this has already been encountered for the
standard header file @file{stdio.h}.

@smallexample

#include <stdio.h>

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
is a command which tells the preprocessor
to treat the file @file{stdio.h} as if it were actually part of the
program text, in other words to include it as part of the program to
be compiled.

Macros are words which can be defined to stand in place of
something complicated: they are a way of reducing the amount of typing
in a program and a way of making long ungainly pieces of code into
short words. For example, the simplest use of macros is to give
constant values meaningful names: e.g.

@smallexample

#define TELEPHNUM 720663

@end smallexample

This allows us to use the word @code{TELEPHNUM} in the program
to mean the number 720663. In this particular case, the word is
clearly not any shorter than the number it will replace, but it is
more meaningful and would make a program read more naturally than if
the raw number were used. For instance, a program which deals with
several different fixed numbers like a telephone number, a postcode
and a street number could write:

@smallexample

printf("%d %d %d",TELEPHNUM,postcode,streetnum);

@end smallexample
@noindent
instead of

@smallexample

printf("%d %d %d",720663,345,14);

@end smallexample
@noindent
Using the macros instead makes the actions much clearer and allows the
programmer to forget about what the numbers actually are. It also
means that a program is easy to alter because to change a telephone
number, or whatever, it is only necessary to change the definition,
not to retype the number in every single instance.

@cindex Macros
@cindex Constants and macros
The important feature of macros is that they are not merely numerical
constants which are referenced at compile time, but are strings which
are physically replaced before compilation by the preprocessor! This
means that almost anything can be defined:

@smallexample

#define SUM  1 + 2 + 3 + 4

@end smallexample
@noindent
would allow @code{SUM} to be used instead of @code{1+2+3+4}. Or

@smallexample

#define STRING "Mary had a little lamb ..."

@end smallexample
@noindent
would allow a commonly used string to be called by the identifier
"string" instead of typing it out afresh each time. The idea of a
define statement then is:

@smallexample

#define @var{macroname}  @var{definition on rest of line}

@end smallexample
Macros cannot define more than a single line to be substituted into a
program but they can be used anywhere, except inside
strings. (Anything enclosed in string quotes is assumed to be complete
and untouchable by the compiler.)
Some macros are defined already in the file @file{stdio.h} such as:

@table @code
@item  EOF
The end of file character (= -1 for instance)
@item NULL
The null character (zero) = 0

@node Macro functions, Macros with parameters, Preprocessor, Preprocessor
@section Macro Functions

A more advanced use of macros is also permitted by the
preprocessor. This involves macros which accept parameters and hand
back values. This works by defining a macro with some dummy parameter,
say @code{x}. For example: a macro which is usually defined in one of the
standard libraries is @code{abs()} which means the absolute or unsigned value
of a number. It is defined below:

@c !!! this node is too complicated; it explains both #define and the 
@c     and `? :' operation at same time

@smallexample
#define ABS(x) ((x) < 0) ? -(x) : (x)
@end smallexample 

@noindent 
The result of this is to give the positive (or unsigned) part of any
number or variable. This would be no problem for a function which could
accept parameters, and it is, in fact, no problem for macros. Macros can
also be made to take parameters. Consider the @code{ABS()} example. If a
programmer were to write @code{ABS(4)} then the preprocessor would
substitute 4 for @code{x}. If a program read @code{ABS(i)} then the
preprocessor would substitute @code{i} for @code{x} and so on. (There is
no reason why macros can't take more than one parameter too. The
programmer just includes two dummy parameters with different names. See
the example listing below.) Notice that this definition uses a curious
operator which belongs to C:

@smallexample

<@var{test}> ? <@var{true result}> : <@var{false result}>

@end smallexample
@noindent
This is like a compact way of writing an @samp{if ... then ... else}
statement, ideal for macros. But it is also slightly different: it is
an expression which returns a value, where as an @samp{if ... then ... else}
is a statement with no value.
Firstly the test is made. If the test is
true then the first statement is carried out, otherwise the second is
carried out. As a memory aid, it could be read as:

@smallexample

if <@var{test}> then <@var{true result}> else <@var{false result}>

@end smallexample
@noindent
(Do not be confused by the above statement which is meant to show what
a programmer might think. It is not a valid C statement.) C can
usually produce much more efficient code for this construction than
for a corresponding if-else statement.

@node Macros with parameters, Example 6, Macro functions, Preprocessor
@section When and when not to use macros with parameters

It is tempting to forget about the distinction between macros and
functions, thinking that it can be ignored. To some extent this is
true for absolute beginners, but it is not a good idea to hold on
to. It should always be remembered that macros are substituted whole
at every place where they are used in a program: this is potentially a
very large amount of repetition of code. The advantage of a macro,
however, is speed. No time is taken up in passing control over to a
new function, because control never leaves the home function when a
macro is used: it just makes the function a bit longer. There is a
limitation with macros though. Function calls cannot be used as their
parameters, such as:

@smallexample

      ABS(function())

@end smallexample
@noindent
has no meaning. Only variables or number constants will be
substituted. Macros are also severely restricted in complexity by the
limitations of the preprocessor. It is simply not viable to copy
complicated sequences of code all over programs.

    Choosing between functions and macros is a matter of personal
judgement. No simple rules can be given. In the end (as with all
programming choices) it is experience which counts towards the final
ends. Functions are easier to debug than macros, since they allow us to
single step through the code. Errors in macros are very hard to find,
and can be very confusing.

@node Note about include, Other Preprocessor commands, Example 6, Preprocessor
@section Note about @code{#include}

When an include statement is written into a program, it is a sign
that a compiler should merge another file of C programming with the
current one. However, the @code{#include} statement is itself valid C, so
this means that a file which is included may contain @code{#include}s
itself. The includes are then said to be "nested". This often makes
includes simpler.

@item #line
Has the form:

@item #line @var{constant} @file{filename}
           This is for debugging mainly. This statement

@sp 1

@cindex Pointers
You have a map (a plan) of the computer's memory. You need to
find that essential piece of information which is stored at some
unknown location. How will you find it? You need a pointer!

@cindex Address of variables
@cindex @samp{&} operator
A pointer is a special type of variable which holds the address or
location of another variable. Pointers point to these locations by
keeping a record of the spot at which they were stored.  Pointers to
variables are found by recording the address at which a variable is
stored. It is always possible to find the address of a
piece of storage in C using the special @samp{&} operator. For instance:
if @code{location} were a float type variable, it would be easy to find
a pointer to it called @code{location_ptr}.

@smallexample

float location;
float *location_ptr,*address;

location_ptr = &(location);

@end smallexample
@noindent
 or 
@smallexample

address = &(location);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The declarations of pointers look a little strange at first. The
star @samp{*} symbol which stands in front of the variable name is C's way of
declaring that variable to be a pointer. The four lines above make two
identical pointers to a floating point variable called @code{location}, one
of them is called @code{location_ptr} and the other is called address. The
point is that a pointer is just a place to keep a record of the
address of a variable, so they are really the same thing.

A pointer is a bundle of information that has two parts.  One part is
the address of the beginning of the segment of memory
that holds whatever is pointed to.  The other part is the type
of value that the pointer points to the beginning of.  This
       tells the computer how much of the memory after the beginning
       to read and how to interpret it.  Thus, if the pointer is of a
       type int, the segment of memory returned will be four bytes
       long (32 bits) and be interpreted as an integer.  In the case
       of a function, the type is the type of value that the function
       will return, although the address is the address of the
       beginning of the function executable.

If, like some modern day programmers, you believe in sanctity of high
level languages, it is probably a source of wonder why anyone
Would ever want to know the address of these variables. Having gone to
the trouble to design a high level language, like C, in which variables
can be given elegant and meaningful names: it seems like a step in the
backward direction to want to be able to find out the exact number of
the memory location at which it is stored! The whole point of variables,
after all, is that it is not necessary to know exactly where information
is really stored.  This is not quite fair though. It is certainly rare
indeed when we should want to know the actual number of the memory
location at which something is stored. That would really make the idea
of a high level language a bit pointless. The idea behind pointers is
that a high level programmer can now find out the exact location of a
variable without ever having to know the actual number
involved. Remember:

@emph{A pointer is a variable which holds the address of the
storage location for another given variable.}

C provides two operators @samp{&} and @samp{*} which allow pointers to
be used in many versatile ways.

@node Pointer operators, Uses for pointers, Pointers, Pointers
@section @samp{&} and @samp{*}

The @samp{&} and @samp{*} operators have already been used once to hand
back values to variable parameters, @xref{Value parameters}. They can be
read in a program to have the following meanings:

@table @code
@item &
The address of ...
@item * 
The contents of the address held in ...
@end table
@noindent
Another way of saying the second of these is:
@table @samp
@item *
The contents of the location pointed to by ...
@end table
@noindent
This reinforces the idea that pointers reach out an imaginary hand and
point to some location in the memory and it is more usual to speak of
pointers in this way. The two operators @samp{*} and @samp{&} are always written in
front of a variable, clinging on, so that they refer, without doubt,
to that one variable. For instance:

@table @samp
@item &x
The address at which the variable @samp{x} is stored.
@item *ptr
The contents of the variable which is pointed to
       by @code{ptr}.
@end table
@noindent
The following example might help to clarify the way in which they are used:

@smallexample

int somevar;                       /* 1 */
int *ptr_to_somevar;               /* 2 */

somevar = 42;                      /* 3 */

ptr_to_somevar = &(somevar);       /* 4 */

printf ("%d",*ptr_to_somevar);     /* 5 */

*ptr_to_somevar = 56;              /* 6 */

@end smallexample

The key to these statements is as follows:

@enumerate
@item 
Declare an @code{int} type variable called @code{somevar}.

@item 
Declare a pointer to an int type called @code{ptr_to_somevar}.
   The @samp{*} which stands in front of @code{ptr_to_somevar} is the
   way C declares @code{ptr_to_somevar} as a pointer to an 
   integer, rather than an integer.

@item 
Let @code{somevar} take the value 42.

@item 
This gives a value to @code{ptr_to_somevar}. The value is the
   address of the variable @code{somevar}. Notice that only
   at this stage does is become a pointer to the particular
   variable @code{somevar}. Before this, its fate is quite open.
   The declaration (2) merely makes it a pointer which can
   point to any integer variable which is around.

@item 
Print out "the contents of the location pointed to by
   @code{ptr_to_somevar}" in other words somevar itself. So this
   will be just 42.

@item 
Let the contents of the location pointed to by
   @code{ptr_to_somevar} be 56. This is the same as the more
   direct statement:

@smallexample

  somevar = 56;

@end smallexample

@end enumerate

@image{img/14.1,12cm}

@node Uses for pointers, Pointers and Initialization, Pointer operators, Pointers
@section Uses for Pointers

It is possible to have pointers which point to any type of data
whatsoever. They are always declared with the @samp{*} symbol. Some examples
are given below.

@smallexample

 int i,*ip;

 char ch,*chp;

 short s,*sp;

 float x,*xp;

 double y,*yp;

@end smallexample
@noindent
Pointers are extremely important objects in C. They are far more
important in C than in, say, Pascal or BASIC (@code{PEEK},@code{POKE}
are like pointers). In particular they are vital when using data
structures like strings or arrays or linked lists.
We shall meet these objects in later chapters.

One example of the use of pointers is the C input function, which
is called @code{scanf()}. It is looked at in detail in the next
section. @code{scanf()} is for getting information from the keyboard. It is a
bit like the reverse of @code{printf()}, except that it uses pointers to
variables, not variables themselves. For example: to read an integer:

@smallexample

 int i;
 scanf ("%d",&i);

@end smallexample
@noindent
or 
@smallexample

 int *i;
 scanf ("%d",i);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The @samp{&} sign or the @samp{*} sign is vital. If it is
forgotten, @code{scanf} will probably corrupt a program. This is one reason
why this important function has been ignored up to now.

Assembly language programmers might argue that there are
occasions on which it would be nice to know the actual address of a
variable as a number. One reason why one might want to know this would
be for debugging. It is not often a useful thing to do, but it is not
inconceivable that in developing some program a programmer would want
to know the actual address. The @samp{&} operator is flexible enough to allow
this to be found. It could be printed out as an integer:

@smallexample

 @var{type} *ptr:

 printf ("Address = %d",(int) ptr);

@end smallexample

@node Pointers and Initialization, Example 8, Uses for pointers, Pointers
@section Pointers and Initialization

Something to be wary of with pointer variables is the way that
they are initialized. It is incorrect, logically, to initialize
pointers in a declaration. A compiler will probably not prevent this
however because there is nothing incorrect about it as far as syntax
is concerned.

Think about what happens when the following statement is
written. This statement is really talking about two different storage
places in the memory:

@smallexample

  int *a = 2;

@end smallexample
@noindent
First of all, what is declared is a pointer, so space for a `pointer
to @code{int}' is allocated by the program and to start off with that space
will contain garbage (random numbers), because no statement like

@smallexample

  a = &someint;

@end smallexample
@noindent
has yet been encountered which would give it a value. It will then
attempt to fill the contents of some variable, pointed to by @code{a}, with
the value 2. This is doomed to failure. a only contains garbage so the
2 could be stored anywhere. There may not even be a variable at the
place in the memory which a points to. Nothing has been said about
that yet. This kind of initialization cannot possibly work and will
most likely crash the program or corrupt some other data.

@section Types, Casts and Pointers

It is tempting but incorrect to think that a pointer to an integer is
the same kind of object as a pointer to a floating point object or any
other type for that matter. This is not necessarily the case. Compilers
distinguish between pointers to different kinds of objects.  There are
occasions however when it is actually necessary to convert one kind of
pointer into another. This might happen with a type of variable called
"unions" or even functions which allocate storage for special
uses. These objects are met later on in this book. When this situation
comes about, the cast operator has to be used to make sure that pointers
have compatible types when they are assigned to one another. The cast
operator for variables, @xref{The Cast Operator}, is written in front of
a variable to force it to be a particular type:

@smallexample

  (@var{type})  @var{variable}

@end smallexample
For pointers it is:
@smallexample

  (@var{type} *) @var{pointer}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Look at the following statement:

@smallexample

 char *ch;
 int  *i;

 i = (int *) ch;

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
This copies the value of the pointer @code{ch} to the pointer
@code{i}. The cast operator makes sure that the pointers are in step and
not talking at cross purposes. The reason that pointers have to be
`cast' into shape is a bit subtle and depends upon particular
computers. In practice it may not actually do anything, but it is a
necessary part of the syntax of C.

Pointer casting is discussed in greater detail in the chapter on
Structures and Unions.

@sp 1

@cindex Pointers to functions
Let's now consider pointers to functions as opposed to variables.
This is an advanced feature which should be used with more than a
little care. The idea behind pointers to functions is that you can
pass a function as a parameter to another function! This seems like
a bizarre notion at first but in fact it makes perfect sense.

Pointers to functions enable you to tell any function which sub-ordinate function
it should use to do its job. That means that you can plug in a new
function in place of an old one just by passing a different parameter
value to the function. You do not have to rewrite any code. In machine
code circles this is sometimes called indirection or vectoring.

@c !!! confusing  -- arrays not yet mentioned:
@cindex Array pointer
When we come to look at arrays, we'll find that
a pointer to the start of an array can be found by
using the name of the array itself without the square brackets
@code{[]}. For functions, the name of the function without the
round brackets works as a pointer to the start of the function,
as long as the compiler understands that the name represents the
function and not a variable with the same name. So---to pass a function
as a parameter to another function you would write
@smallexample

 function1(function2);

@end smallexample
@noindent
If you try this as it stands, a stream of compilation errors
will be the result. The reason is that you must declare @code{function2()}
explicitly like this:

@smallexample
int function2();
@end smallexample

@c !!! confusing -- void not yet mentioned:
@noindent
If the function returns a different type then clearly the declaration
will be different but the form will be the same.  The declaration can be
placed together with other declarations.  It is not important whether
the variable is declared locally or globally, since a function is a
global object regardless. What is important is that  we declare
specifically a pointer to a function which returns a type (even
if it is @code{void}). The function which accepts a function pointer
as an argument looks like this:

@smallexample
 function1 (a)

 int (*a)();

 @{ int i;

 i = (*a)(@var{parameters});
 @}
@end smallexample

@noindent
This declares the formal parameter @code{a} to be a pointer to a
function returning a value of type @code{int}. Similarly if you want to
declare a pointer to a function to a general type @var{typename} with
the name @code{fnptr}, you would do it like this:
@smallexample

 @var{typename} (*fnptr)();

@end smallexample

@node Calling functions by pointer, Questions 13, Function pointers, Pointers
@section Calling a function by pointer

Given a pointer to a function how do we call the function?
The syntax is this:
@smallexample

 @var{variable} = (*fnptr)(@var{parameters});

@end smallexample

An example let us look at a function which takes an integer
and returns a character.
@smallexample

 int i;
 char ch, function();

@end smallexample
@noindent
Normally this function is called using the statement:
@smallexample

 ch = function(i);

@end smallexample
@noindent
but we can also do the same thing with a pointer to the function.
First define
@smallexample

 char function();
 char (*fnptr)();

 fnptr = function;

@end smallexample
@noindent
then call the function with
@smallexample

 ch = (*fnptr)(i);

@end smallexample
A pointer to a function can be used to provide
a kind of plug-in interface to a logical device, i.e.
a way of choosing the right function for the job.
@smallexample

void printer(),textscreen(),windows();

switch (choice)
   @{
   case 1: fnptr = printer;
           break;
   case 2: fnptr = textscreen;
        break;
   case 3: fnptr = windows;
   @}

 Output(data,fnptr);

@end smallexample

This is the basis of `polymorphism' found in object
oriented languages: a choice of a logical (virtual)
function based on some abstract label (the choice).
The C++ language provides an abstract form of this with a more
advanced syntax, but this is the essence of virtual function methods
in object oriented languages.

@b{BEWARE!} A pointer to a function is an automatic local variable.
Local variables are never initialized by the compiler in C. If you
inadvertently forget to initialize the pointer to a function, you
will come quickly to grief. Make sure that your pointers are
assigned before you use them!

@cindex Standard input/output

Getting information in and out of a computer is the most
important thing that a program can do. Without input and output
computers would be quite useless.

C treats all its output as though it were reading or writing to
different files. A file is really just an abstraction: a place
where information comes from or can be sent to. Some files can only be
read, some can only be written to, others can be both read from and
written to. In other situations files are called I/O streams.
@cindex Files as abstractions
@cindex Streams
@cindex stdin
@cindex stderr
@cindex stdout

@image{img/15.1,12cm}

C has three files (also called streams) which are always open and ready for
use. They are called @emph{stdin}, @emph{stdout} and @emph{stderr},
meaning standard input and standard output and standard error
file. Stdin is the input which usually arrives from the keyboard of a
computer. stdout is usually the screen. stderr is the route by which
all error messages pass: usually the screen. This is only `usually'
because the situation can be altered. In fact what happens is that
these files are just handed over to the local operating system to deal
with and it chooses what to do with them. Usually this means the
keyboard and the screen, but it can also be redirected to
a printer or to a disk file or to a modem etc depending upon how the
user ran the program.

@cindex Keyboard input
@cindex Screen output
The keyboard and screen are referred to as the standard input/output
files because this is what most people use, most of the time. Also the
programmer never has to open or close these, because C does it
automatically. The C library functions covered by @file{stdio.h}
provides some methods for working with @code{stdin} and
@code{stdout}. They are simplified versions of the functions that can be
used on any kind of file, @xref{Files and Devices}. In order of
importance, they are:

@node printf again, Example 9, Standard Output and Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section @code{printf}

@cindex printf function
The @code{printf} function has been used widely up to now for output
because it provides a neat and easy way of printing text and numbers
to stdout (the screen). Its name is meant to signify formatted printing
because it gives the user control over how text and numerical data are
to be laid out on the screen.
Making text look good on screen is important in programming. C
makes this easy by allowing you to decide how the text will
be printed in the available space. The @code{printf} function has the general
form:

@smallexample

printf ("string ...",@var{variables},@var{numbers})

@end smallexample
@noindent
It contains a string (which is not optional)
and it contains any number of parameters to follow: one for each blank
field in the string.

The blank fields are control sequences which one can put
into the string to be filled in with numbers or the contents
of variables before the final result is printed out. These fields
are introduced by using a @samp{%} character, followed by some coded
information, which says something about the size of the blank space
and the type of number or string which will be filled into that
space. Often the string is called the control string because it
contains these control characters.

The simplest use of @code{printf} is to just print out a string with no
blank fields to be filled:

@smallexample

 printf ("A pretty ordinary string ...");
 printf ("Testing 1, 2, 3, ...");

@end smallexample

The next simplest case that has been used before now is to print
out a single integer number:

@smallexample

 int number = 42;

 printf ("%d",number);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The two can be combined:

@smallexample

 int number = 42;

 printf ("Some number = %d",number);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The result of this last example is to print out the following on the screen:
@smallexample

 Some number = 42

@end smallexample
@noindent
The text cursor is left pointing to the character just after the
2. Notice the way that @code{%d} is swapped for the number 42. @code{%d}
defines a field which is filled in with the value of the variable.

There are other kinds of data than integers though. Any kind of variable
can be printed out with @code{printf}. @code{%d} is called a conversion
character for integers because it tells the compiler to treat the
variable to be filled into it as an integer. So it better had be an
integer or things will go wrong! Other characters are used for other
kinds of data. Here is a list of the different letters for
@code{printf}.

@table @code
@item d
signed denary integer
@item u
unsigned denary integer
@item x
hexadecimal integer
@item o

string
@item c
single character
@item f
fixed decimal floating point
@item e
scientific notation floating point
@item g
use @code{f} or @code{e}, whichever is shorter
@end table

The best way to learn these is to experiment with different
conversion characters. The example program and its output below give
some impression of how they work:

@section Formatting with @code{printf}

The example program above does not produce a very neat layout on the
screen. The conversion specifiers in the printf string can be extended
to give more information. The @samp{%} and the character type act like
brackets around the extra information. e.g.
@smallexample

                 %-10.3f

@end smallexample
@noindent
is an extended version of @samp{%f}, which carries some more
information. That extra information takes the form:

@c !!! confusing -- the brackets mark content that is optional.  the brackets
@c     are not part of the format.
@smallexample
               % [-] [@var{fwidth}] [.@var{p}] X
@end smallexample

@noindent
where the brackets are used to denote that the item is optional 
and the symbols inside them stand
for the following.

@table @code
@item [@var{fwidth}] 
This is a number which specifies the field width of
     this "blank field". In other words, how wide a space
     will be made in the string for the object concerned?
          In fact it is the minimum field width because if
     data need more room than is written here they will
     spill out of their box of fixed size. If the size is
     bigger than the object to be printed, the rest of the
     field will be filled out with spaces.

@item [-]  
If this is included the output will be left justified.
     This means it will be aligned with the left hand 
     margin of the field created with
@code{[@var{fwidth}]}. Normally all
     numbers are right justified, or aligned with the
     right hand margin of the field "box".

@item [.@var{p}] 
This has different meanings depending on the object which is to be
printed. For a floating point type (@code{float} or @code{double})
@var{p} specifies the number of decimal places after the point which are
to be printed. For a string it specifies how many characters are to be
printed.

@node scanf, Conversion characters, Questions 14a, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section @code{scanf}

@code{scanf} is the input function which gets formatted input from the
file @code{stdin} (the keyboard). This is a very versatile function but it is
also very easy to go wrong with. In fact it is probably the most
difficult to understand of all the C standard library functions.

@cindex scanf
Remember that C treats its keyboard input as a file. This makes
quite a difference to the way that scanf works. The actual mechanics
of @code{scanf} are very similar to those of printf in reverse
@smallexample

scanf ("string ...",pointers);

@end smallexample
@noindent
with one important exception: namely that it is not variables which
are listed after the control string, but pointers to variables. Here
are some valid uses of @code{scanf}:

@smallexample

int i;
char ch;
float x;

scanf ("%d %c %f", &i, &ch, &x);

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice the @samp{&} characters which make the arguments pointers. Also notice
the conversion specifiers which tell scanf what types of data it is
going to read. The other possibility is that a program might already
have pointers to a particular set of variables in that case the @samp{&} is
not needed. For instance:
@smallexample

function (i,ch,x)

int *i;
char *ch;
float *x;

@{
scanf ("%d %c %f", i, ch, x);
@}

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
In this case it would actually be wrong to
write the ampersand @samp{&} symbol.

@node Conversion characters, How does scanf see the input, scanf, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section Conversion characters

The conversion characters for scanf are not identical to those
for @code{printf} and it is much more important to be precise and totally
correct with these than it is with @code{printf}.

@noindent
The difference between short integer and long integer can make or
break a program. If it is found that a program's input seems to be
behaving strangely, check these carefully. (See the chapter on Errors
and Debugging for more about this.)

@node How does scanf see the input, First account of scanf, Conversion characters, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section How does scanf see the input?

When @code{scanf} is called in a program it checks to see what is
in the input file, that is, it checks to see what the user has typed
in at the keyboard. Keyboard input is usually buffered. This means
that the characters are held in a kind of waiting bay in the memory
until they are read. The buffer can be thought of as a part of the
input file stdin, holding some characters which can be scanned
through. If the buffer has some characters in it, @code{scanf} will start to
look through these; if not, it will wait for some characters to be put
into the buffer.

    There is an important point here: although @code{scanf} will start
scanning through characters as soon as they are in the buffer, the
operating system often sees to it that @code{scanf} doesn't get to know
about any of the characters until the user has pressed the @kbd{RETURN}
or @kbd{ENTER} key on the computer or terminal. If the buffer is empty
@code{scanf} will wait for some characters to be put into it.

To understand how @code{scanf} works, it is useful to think of the input
as coming in `lines'. A line is a bunch of characters ending in a
newline character @samp{\n}. This can be represented by a box like the one
below:
@smallexample

 --------------------------------------
| some...characters.738/.         |'\n'|
 --------------------------------------

@end smallexample

@cindex Streams
As far as @code{scanf} is concerned, the input is entirely made out of
a stream of characters. If the programmer says that an integer is to be expected
by using the @samp{%d} conversion specifier then @code{scanf} will try to make
sense of the characters as an integer. In other words, it will look
for some characters which make up a valid integer, such as a group of
numbers all between 0 and 9. If the user says that floating point type
is expected then it will look for a number which may or may not have a
decimal point in it. If the user just wants a character then any
character will do!

@node First account of scanf, The dangerous function, How does scanf see the input, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section First account of scanf

Consider the example which was given above.

@smallexample

int i;
char ch;
float x;

scanf ("%d %c %f", &i, &ch, &x);

@end smallexample
@noindent
Here is a simplified, ideal view of what happens.
@code{scanf} looks at the control string and finds that the first
conversion specifier is @samp{%d} which means an integer. It then tries to
find some characters which fit the description of an integer in the
input file. It skips over any white space characters (spaces,
newlines) which do not constitute a valid integer until it matches
one. Once it has matched the integer and placed its value in the
variable @code{i} it carries on and looks at the next conversion specifier
@samp{%c} which means a character. It takes the next character and places
it in @code{ch}. Finally it looks at the last conversion specifier @samp{%f}
which means a floating point number and finds some characters which
fit the description of a floating point number. It passes the value
onto the variable @code{x} and then quits.

This brief account of @code{scanf} does not tell the whole story by a
long way. It assumes that all the characters were successfully found
and that everything went smoothly: something which seldom happens in
practice!

@node The dangerous function, Keeping scanf under control, First account of scanf, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section The dangerous function

What happens if scanf doesn't find an integer or a float type?
The answer is that it will quit at the first item it fails to match,
leaving that character and the rest of the input line still to be read
in the file. At the first character it meets which does not fit in
with the conversion string's interpretation scanf aborts and control
passes to the next C statement. This is why @code{scanf} is a `dangerous'
function: because it can quit in the middle of a task and leave a lot
of surplus data around in the input file. These surplus data simply
wait in the input file until the next @code{scanf} is brought into operation,
where they can also cause it to quit. It is not safe, therefore, to
use scanf by itself: without some check that it is working
successfully.

@cindex scanf, dangers
@code{scanf} is also dangerous for the opposite reason: what
happens if @code{scanf} doesn't use up all the characters in the input
line before it satisfies its needs? Again the answer is that it quits
and leaves the extra characters in the input file @code{stdin} for the
next @code{scanf} to read, exactly where it left off. So if the
program was meant to read data from the input and couldn't, it leaves
a mess for something else to trip over.
@code{scanf} can get out of step with its input if the user types
something even slightly out of line.  It should be used with
caution ...

@node Keeping scanf under control, Example 11, The dangerous function, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section Keeping scanf under control

@code{scanf} may be dangerous for sloppy programs which do not check
their input carefully, but it is easily tamed by using it as just a
part of a more sophisticated input routine and sometimes even more
simply with the aid of a very short function which can be incorporated
into any program:
@smallexample

skipgarb()        /* skip garbage corrupting scanf */

@{
while (getchar() != '\n')
   @{
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
The action of this function is simply to skip to the end of the
input line so that there are no characters left in the input. It
cannot stop scanf from getting out of step before the end of a line
because no function can stop the user from typing in nonsense! So to
get a single integer, for instance, a program could try:
@smallexample

int i;

scanf("%d",&i);
skipgarb();

@end smallexample
@noindent
The programmer must police user-garbage personally by using a loop to
the effect of:
@smallexample

while (inputisnonsense)

@{
printf ("Get your act together out there!!\n");
scanf (...)
skipgarb();
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
It is usually as well to use @code{skipgarb()} every time.

@node Example 11, Matching without assigning, Keeping scanf under control, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section Examples

Here are some example programs with example runs to show how
@code{scanf} either works or fails.

@c !!! confusing -- need to explain that conversion specifiers are to tell
@c             computer what the pointers point to.


@smallexample

/****************************************/

  char ch = '*';
  float x = 0;


scanf ("%d %c %f",&i,&ch,&x);

printf ("%d %c %f\n",i,ch,x);
@}

@end smallexample
This program just waits for a line from the user and prints out
what it makes of that line. Things to notice about these examples are
the way in which @code{scanf} `misunderstands' what the user has typed in and
also the values which the variables had before the scanf function.

@image{img/15.2,12cm}

@smallexample

Input : 1x2.3
Output: 1 x 2.300000

@end smallexample
@noindent
The input gets broken up in the following way:
@smallexample

                 ------------------
                | 1 |'x'| 2.3 |'\n'|
                 ------------------

@end smallexample
@noindent
In this example everything works properly. There are no spaces to
confuse matters. it is simple for @code{scanf} to see what the first number
is because the next character is @code{x} which is not a valid number.
@smallexample

Input : 1 x 2.3
Output: 1   0.000000

                 ------         ------
                |1|' '| <break> |x 2.3|
                 ------         ------

@end smallexample
@noindent
In this example the integer is correctly matched as 1. The character is
now a space and the @code{x} is left in the stream.  The @code{x} does
not match the description of a float value so @code{scanf} terminates,
leaving @code{x 2.3} still in the input stream.
@smallexample

Input : .
Output: 0 * 0.000000

                          ---
                         |'.'| <break>
                          ---

@end smallexample

@image{img/15.3,12cm}

@noindent
A single full-stop (period). @code{scanf} quits straight away because it
looks for an integer. It leaves the whole input line (which is just
the period @samp{.}) in the input stream.
@smallexample

/****************************************/

scanf ("%c %c", &ch2,&ch3);
printf ("%d %c %f\n %c %c",i,ch,x,ch2,ch3);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The input for this program is:
@smallexample

6 x2.36

and the output is:

6   0.000000

 ---------           -------------
| 6 | ' ' | <break> |'x'|'2'| .36 |
 ---------           -------------

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
Here the integer is successfully matched
with 6. The character is matched with a space but the float character
finds an @code{x} in the way, so the first @code{scanf} aborts leaving
the value of @code{x} unchanged and the rest of the characters still
in the file. The second scanf function then picks these up. It can be
seen that the first two characters are the @code{x} which caused the previous
@code{scanf} to fail and the first 2 of the intended floating point number.

@node Matching without assigning, Formal Definition of scanf, Example 11, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section Matching without assigning


@code{scanf} allows input types to be matched but then discarded without
being assigned to any variable. It also allows whole sequences of
characters to be matched and skipped. For example:
@smallexample

scanf ("%*c");

@end smallexample
would skip a single character. The @samp{*} character means do not make an
assignment. Note carefully that the following is @emph{wrong}:
@smallexample

scanf ("%*c", &ch);

@end smallexample
@noindent
A pointer should not be given for a dummy conversion character. In this
simple case above it probably does not matter, but in a string with
several things to be matched, it would make the conversion characters
out of step with the variables, since @code{scanf} does not return a
value from a dummy conversion character.  It might seem as though there
would be no sense in writing:
@smallexample

     scanf ("%*s %f %c",&x,&ch);

@end smallexample
@noindent
because the whole input file is one long string after all, but this is
not true because, as far as @code{scanf} is concerned a string is
terminated by any white space character, so the float type @code{x} and the
character @code{ch} would receive values provided there were a space or
newline character after any string.

If any non-conversion characters are typed into the string scanf
will match and skip over them in the input. For example:
@smallexample

     scanf (" Number = %d",&i);

@end smallexample
If the input were: @kbd{Number = 256}, @code{scanf} would skip over the
@kbd{Number = }. As usual, if the string cannot be matched, @code{scanf}
will abort, leaving the remaining characters in the input stream.

@smallexample

/****************************************/
/* Example 4                            */
/****************************************/

#include <stdio.h>

main()

@{ float x = 0;
  int i = 0;
  char ch = '*';

scanf("Skipthis! %*f %d %*c",&i);

printf("%f %d %c",x,i,ch);

@}

@end smallexample

@smallexample

Input : Skipthis! 23
Output: 0.000000 23 *

Input : 26
Output: 0.000000 0 *

@end smallexample
@noindent
In this last case @code{scanf} aborted before matching anything.

@node Formal Definition of scanf, Summary of points about scanf, Matching without assigning, Standard Output and Standard Input
@section Formal Definition of scanf


The general form of the @code{scanf} function is:
@smallexample

     n = scanf ("string ...", pointers);

@end smallexample
The value @code{n} returned is the number of items matched or the end of
file character @code{EOF}, or @code{NULL} if the first item did not match. This value
is often discarded.  The control string contains a number of conversion
specifiers with the following general form:
@smallexample

               %[*][n]X

@end smallexample
@table @code
@item [*]
the optional assignment suppression character.

@item [n]
this is a number giving the maximum field width to be
      accepted by scanf for a particular item. That is, the
      maximum number of characters which are to be thought
      of as being part of the current variable value.
@item X 
is one of the characters listed above.
@end table
@noindent
Any white space characters in the @code{scanf} string are ignored. Any other
characters are matched. The pointers must be pointers to variables of
the correct type and they must match the conversion specifiers in the
order in which they are written.

There are two variations on the conversion specifiers for
strings, though it is very likely that many compilers will not support
this. Both of the following imply strings:

@table @code
@item %[@var{set of characters}]
a string made up of the given characters only.

@item %[^@var{set of characters}]
a string which is delimited by the set of characters given.

@end table
@noindent
For example, to read the rest of a line of text, up to
but not including the end of line, into a string
array one would write:
@smallexample

 scanf("%[^\n]",stringarray);

@code{scanf()} and @code{printf()} are relatively high level functions:
this means that they are versatile and do a lot of hidden work for the
user. C also provides some functions for dealing with input and output
at a lower level: character by character. These functions are called
@code{getchar()} and @code{putchar()} but, in fact, they might not be
functions: they could be macros instead, @xref{Preprocessor}.

low level: putchar()       |         getchar()
                           |

@end smallexample

@noindent
@code{getchar} gets a single character from the input file stdin;
@code{putchar} writes a single character to the output file
stdout. @code{getchar} returns a character type: the next character on the
input file. For example:

@smallexample

char ch;

ch = getchar();

@end smallexample
@noindent
This places the next character, what ever it might be, into the
variable ch. Notice that no conversion to different data types can be
performed by @code{getchar()} because it deals with single characters
only. It is a low level function and does not `know' anything about
data types other than characters.

@code{getchar} was used in the function @code{skipgarb()}
 to tame the @code{scanf()}
function. This function was written in a very compact way. Another way
of writing it would be as below:
@smallexample

skipgarb ()    /* skip garbage corrupting scanf */

@{ char ch;

ch = getchar();

while (ch != '\n')
   @{
   ch = getchar();
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The @samp{!=} symbol means "is not equal to" and the while statement is a
loop. This function keeps on @code{getchar}-ing until it finds the newline
character and then it quits. This function has many uses. One of these
is to copy immediate keypress statements of languages like BASIC,
where a program responds to keys as they are pressed without having to
wait for return to be pressed. Without special library functions to
give this kind of input (which are not universal) it is only possible
to do this with the return key itself. For example:
@smallexample

printf("Press RETURN to continue\n");

skipgarb();

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
@code{skipgarb()} does not receive any
input until the user presses @kbd{RETURN}, and then it simply skips
over it in one go! The effect is that it waits for @kbd{RETURN} to be
pressed.

@code{putchar()} writes a character type and also returns a character
type. For example:
@smallexample

char ch = '*';

putchar (ch);
ch = putchar (ch);

@end smallexample
@noindent
These two alternatives have the same effect. The value returned by
@code{putchar()} is the character which was written to the output. In other
words it just hands the same value back again. This can simply be
discarded, as in the first line. @code{putchar()} is not much use without
loops to repeat it over and over again.

@cindex putchar
An important point to remember is that @code{putchar()} and
@code{getchar()} could well be implemented as macros, rather than
functions. This means that it might not be possible to use functions
as parameters inside them:
@smallexample

               putchar( function() );

@end smallexample
@noindent
This depends entirely upon the compiler, but it is something to watch
out for.

@cindex Operators
An @code{operator} is something which takes one or more values and does
something useful with those values to produce a result. It operates on
them. The terminology of operators is the following:

@table @emph
@item operator
Something which operates on something.

@item operand
Each thing which is operated upon by an
            operator is called an operand.

@item operation 
The action which was carried out upon the
            operands by the operator!
@end table
@noindent
There are lots of operators in C. Some of them may already be familiar:
@smallexample

     +  -  *  /  =  & ==

@end smallexample
@noindent
Most operators can be thought of as belonging to one of three groups,
divided up arbitrarily according to what they do with their
operands. These rough groupings are thought of as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item  Operators which produce new values from old ones.
   They make a result from their operands. e.g. @code{+}, the
   addition operator takes two numbers or two variables
   or a number and a variable and adds them together to
   give a new number.

@item  Operators which make comparisons. e.g. less than,
   equal to, greater than ...

@item  Operators which produce new variable types: like the
   cast operator.

@end itemize

The majority of operators fall into the first group. In fact
the second group is a subset of the first, in which the result
of the operation is a boolean value of either @code{true} of @code{false}.

C has no less than thirty nine different operators. This is more
than, say, Pascal and BASIC put together! The operators serve a
variety of purposes and they can be used very freely. The object of
this chapter is to explain the basics of operators in C. The more
abstruse operators are looked at in another chapter.

@section Expressions and values

The most common operators in any language are basic arithmetic
operators. In C these are the following:

@table @code
@item +  
plus  (unary)
@item -  
minus (force value to be negative)
@item +  
addition
@item -  
subtraction
@item *  
multiplication
@item /  
floating point division
@item /  
integer division "div"
@item %
  integer remainder "mod"

@end table
@noindent
These operators would not be useful without a partner operator
which could attach the values which they produce to variables. Perhaps
the most important operator then is the assignment operator:
@smallexample

=   assignment operator 

@end smallexample
This has been used extensively up to now. For example:
@smallexample

double x,y;

x = 2.356;
y = x;

x = x + 2 + 3/5;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The assignment operator takes the value of whatever is on the right
hand side of the @samp{=} symbol and puts it into the variable on the left
hand side. As usual there is some standard jargon for this, which is
useful to know because compilers tend to use this when handing out
error messages. The assignment operator can be summarized in the
following way:
@smallexample

     @var{lvalue} = @var{expression};

@end smallexample
@noindent
This statement says no more than what has been said about assignments
already: namely that it takes something on the right hand side and
attaches it to whatever is on the left hand side of the @samp{=} symbol. An
@emph{expression} is simply the name for any string of operators, variables
and numbers. All of the following could be called expressions:
@smallexample

1 + 2 + 3

a + somefunction()

32 * x/3

i % 4

x

1

(22 + 4*(function() + 2))

function ()  /* provided it returns a sensible value */

@end smallexample
@noindent
@emph{Lvalues} on the other hand are simply names for memory locations: in
other words variable names, or identifiers. The name comes from `left
values' meaning anything which can legally be written on the left hand
side of an assignment.

@node Parentheses and Priority, Unary Operator Precedence, Output 12, Assignments Expressions and Operators
@section Parentheses and Priority

Parentheses are classed as operators by the compiler, although their
position is a bit unclear. They have a value in the sense that they
assume the value of whatever expression is inside them. Parentheses are used for
forcing a priority over operators. If an expression is written out in
an ambiguous way, such as:
@smallexample

     a + b / 4 * 2

@end smallexample
@noindent
it is not clear what is meant by this. It could be interpreted in 
several ways:
@smallexample

     ((a + b) / 4) * 2

@end smallexample
@noindent
or
@smallexample

     (a + b)/ (4 * 2)

@end smallexample
@noindent
or
@smallexample

     a + (b/4) * 2

@end smallexample
@noindent
and so on.
By using parentheses, any doubt about what the expression means is
removed. Parentheses are said to have a higher priority than + * or /
because they are evaluated as "sealed capsules" before other operators
can act on them. Putting parentheses in may remove the ambiguity of
expressions, but it does not alter the fact that
@smallexample

    a + b / 4 * 2

@end smallexample
@noindent
is ambiguous. What will happen in this case? The answer is that the C
compiler has a convention about the way in which expressions are
evaluated: it is called operator precedence. The convention is that
some operators are stronger than others and that the stronger ones
will always be evaluated first. Otherwise, expressions like the one
above are evaluated from left to right: so an expression will be dealt
with from left to right unless a strong operator overrides this
rule. Use parentheses to be sure.
A table of all operators and their priorities is given later.

@node Unary Operator Precedence, Special Assignment Operators @code{++} @code{--}, Parentheses and Priority, Assignments Expressions and Operators
@section Unary Operator Precedence

Unary operators are operators which have only a single operand:
that is, they operate on only one object. For instance:
@smallexample

     ++  --  +  -  & 

@end smallexample
@noindent
The precedence of unary operators is from right to left so an
expression like:
@smallexample

     *ptr++;

@end smallexample
@noindent
would do @code{++} before @code{*}.

@node Special Assignment Operators @code{++} @code{--}, More Special Assignments, Unary Operator Precedence, Assignments Expressions and Operators
@section Special Assignment Operators @code{++} and @code{--}

C has some special operators which cut down on the amount of
typing involved in a program. This is a subject in which it becomes
important to think in C and not in other languages. The simplest of
these perhaps are the increment and decrement operators:
@table @code

@item ++  
increment: add one to
@item --  
decrement: subtract one from
@end table
@noindent
These attach to any variable of integer or floating point
type. (character types too, with care.)  They are used to simply add
or subtract 1 from a variable. Normally, in other languages, this is
accomplished by writing:
@smallexample

variable = variable + 1;

@end smallexample
@noindent
In C this would also be quite valid, but there is a much better way of
doing this:
@smallexample

variable++; or
++variable;

@end smallexample
@noindent
would do the same thing more neatly. Similarly:
@smallexample

variable = variable - 1;

@end smallexample
@noindent
is equivalent to:
@smallexample

variable--;

@end smallexample
@noindent
or
@smallexample

--variable;

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice particularly that these two operators can be placed in front or
after the name of the variable. In some cases the two are identical,
but in the more advanced uses of C operators, which appear later in
this book, there is a subtle difference between the two.

@node More Special Assignments, Example 13, Special Assignment Operators @code{++} @code{--}, Assignments Expressions and Operators
@section More Special Assignments

Here are some of the nicest operators in C. Like @code{++} and
@code{--} these are short ways of writing longer expressions. Consider
the statement:
@smallexample

variable = variable + 23;

@end smallexample
@noindent
In C this would be a long winded way of adding 23 to @code{variable}. It
could be done more simply using the general increment operator: @code{+=}
@smallexample

variable += 23;

@end smallexample
@noindent
This performs exactly the same operation. Similarly one could write:
@smallexample

variable1 = variable1 + variable2;

@end smallexample
as
@noindent
@smallexample

variable1 += variable2;

@end smallexample
@noindent
and so on. There is a handful of these
@smallexample

    <operation>=

@end smallexample
@noindent
operators: one for each of the major operations which can be
performed. There is, naturally, one for subtraction too:
@smallexample

   variable = variable - 42;

@end smallexample
@noindent
can be written:
@smallexample

  variable -= 42;

@end smallexample
@noindent
More surprisingly, perhaps, the multiplicative assignment:
@smallexample

  variable = variable * 2;

@end smallexample
@noindent
may be written:
@smallexample

  variable *= 2;

@end smallexample
@noindent
and so on. The main arithmetic operators all follow this pattern:
@table @code
@item += 
add assign
@item -= 
subtract assign
@item *= 
multiply assign
@item /= 
divide (double) and (int) types
@item %= 
remainder (int) type only.
@end table
and there are more exotic kinds, used for bit operations or machine
level operations, which will be ignored at this stage:
@smallexample

>>=
<<=
^=
|=
&=

@node The Cast Operator, Expressions and Types, Output 13, Assignments Expressions and Operators
@section The Cast Operator

The cast operator is an operator which forces a particular type
mould or type cast onto a value, hence the name. For instance a
character type variable could be forced to fit into an integer type
box by the statement:
@smallexample

     char ch;
     int i;

     i = (int) ch;

@end smallexample
This operator was introduced earlier, @xref{Variables}. It will always
produce some value, whatever the conversion: however remotely improbable
it might seem. For instance it is quite possible to convert a character
into a floating point number: the result will be a floating point
representation of its ASCII code!

@node Expressions and Types, Summary of Operators and Precedence, The Cast Operator, Assignments Expressions and Operators
@section Expressions and Types

There is a rule in C that all arithmetic and mathematical
operations must be carried out with @code{long} variables: that is, the
types

@smallexample

double
long float

int
long int

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
If the programmer tries to use other types
like @code{short} or @code{float} in a mathematical expression they
will be cast into long types automatically by the compiler. This can
cause confusion because the compiler will spot an error in the
following statement:
@smallexample

short i, j = 2;

i = j * 2 + 1;

@end smallexample
@noindent
A compiler will claim that there is a type mismatch between @code{i} and the
expression on the right hand side of the assignment. The compiler is
perfectly correct of course, even though it appears to be wrong. The
subtlety is that arithmetic cannot be done in short type variables, so
that the expression is automatically converted into @code{long} type or @code{int}
type. So the right hand side is @code{int} type and the left hand side is
@code{short} type: hence there is indeed a type mismatch. The programmer
can get around this by using the cast operator to write:
@smallexample

short i, j = 2;

i = (short) j * 2 + 1;

@end smallexample
@noindent
A similar thing would happen with float:
@smallexample

float x, y = 2.3;

x = y * 2.5;

@end smallexample
@noindent
would also be incorrect for the same reasons as above.

@noindent Comparisons and Logic
@section Comparisons and Logic

Six operators in C are for making logical comparisons. The
relevance of these operators will quickly become clear in the next
chapter, which is about decisions and comparisons. The six operators
which compare values are:
@table @code
@item == 
is equal to
@item != 
is not equal to
@item >  
is greater than
@item <  
is less than
@item >= 
is greater than or equal to
@item <= 
is less than or equal to
@end table
@noindent
These operators belong to the second group according to the scheme
above but they do actually result in values so that they could be
thought of as being a part of the first group of operators too. The
values which they produce are called true and false. As words, "true"
and "false" are not defined normally in C, but it is easy to define
them as macros and they may well be defined in a library file:
@smallexample

#define TRUE  1
#define FALSE 0

@end smallexample
@noindent
Falsity is assumed to have the value zero in C and truth is represented
by any non-zero value. These comparison operators are used for making
decisions, but they are themselves operators and expressions can be
built up with them.
@smallexample

1 == 1   

@end smallexample
@noindent
has the value "true" (which could be anything except zero).
The statement:
@smallexample

int i;

i = (1 == 2);

@end smallexample
@noindent
would be false, so @code{i} would be false. In other words, @code{i} would be zero.

Comparisons are often made in pairs or even in groups and linked
together with words like OR and AND. For instance, some test might
want to find out whether:
@smallexample

     @var{(A is greater than B) AND (A is greater than C)}

@end smallexample
@noindent
C does not have words for these operations but gives symbols
instead. The logical operators, as they are called, are as follows:
@table @code
@item &&   
logical AND
@item ||   
logical OR inclusive
@item !    
logical NOT
@end table
@noindent
The statement which was written in words above could be translated as:
@smallexample

     (A > B) && (A > C)

@end smallexample
@noindent
The statement:
@smallexample

(A is greater than B) AND (A is not greater than C)

@end smallexample
@noindent
translates to:
@smallexample

    (A > B) && !(A > C)

@end smallexample
@noindent
Shakespeare might have been disappointed to learn that, whatever the
value of a variable @code{to_be} the result of
@smallexample

  the_question = to_be || !to_be

@end smallexample
@noindent
must always be true. The NOT operator always creates the logical
opposite: @code{!true} is false and @code{!false} is true. One or the
other of these must be true. @code{the_question} is therefore always
true. Fortunately this is not a matter of life or death!

Suppose that a fictional traveller, some character in a book like
this one, came to the end of a straight, unfinished road and waited
there for the author to decide where the road would lead. The author
might decide a number of things about this road and its traveller:

@itemize @bullet
@item The road will carry on in a straight line.
     If the traveller is thirsty he will stop for a drink before
continuing.

@item The road will fork and the traveller will have to
     decide whether to take the left branch or the right
     branch.

@item The road might have a crossroads or a meeting point
     where many roads come together. Again the traveller
     has to decide which way to go.
@end itemize
@noindent
We are often faced with this dilemma: a situation in which a decision
has to be made. Up to now the simple example programs in this book
have not had any choice about the way in which they progressed. They
have all followed narrow paths without any choice about which way they
were going. This is a very limited way of expressing ideas though: the
ability to make decisions and to choose different options is very
useful in programming. For instance, one might want to implement the
following ideas in different programs:
@itemize @bullet
@item If the user hits the jackpot, write some message to
     say so. "You've won the game!"

@item  If a bank balance is positive then print C for credit
     otherwise print D for debit.

@item If the user has typed in one of five things then do
     something special for each special case, otherwise do
     something else.
@end itemize
@noindent
These choices are actually just the same choices that the
traveller had to make on his undecided path, thinly disguised. In the
first case there is a simple choice: a do of don't choice. The second
case gives two choices: do thing 1 or thing 2. The final choice has
several possibilities.

C offers four ways of making decisions like the ones above. They
are listed here below.  The method which is numbered 2b was
encountered in connection with the C preprocessor; its purpose is very
similar to 2a.

Notice that, as well as a single statement, a whole block of statements
can be written under the if statement. In fact, there is an unwritten
rule of thumb in C that wherever a single statement will do, a
@emph{compound statement} will do instead. A compound statement is a
block of single statements enclosed by curly braces.

A condition is usually some kind of comparison, like the ones discussed
in the previous chapter. It must have a value which is either true or
false (1 or 0) and it must be enclosed by the parentheses @code{(} and
@code{)}. If the condition has the value `true' then the statement or
compound statement following the condition will be carried out,
otherwise it will be ignored. Some of the following examples help to
show this:
@smallexample

int i;

printf ("Type in an integer");

scanf ("%ld",&i);

if (i == 0)
   @{
   printf ("The number was zero");
   @}

if (i > 0)
   @{
   printf ("The number was positive");
   @}

if (i < 0)
   @{
   printf ("The number was negative");
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The same code could be written more briefly, but perhaps less
consistently in the following way:
@smallexample

int i;

printf ("Type in an integer");

scanf ("%ld",&i);

if (i == 0) printf ("The number was zero");
if (i > 0) printf ("The number was positive");
if (i < 0) printf ("The number was negative");

@end smallexample
@noindent
The preference in this book is to include the block braces,
even when they are not strictly required. This does no harm. It is no
more or less efficient, but very often you will find that
some extra statements have to go into those braces, so it is as well
to include them from the start. It also has the appeal that it makes
@code{if} statements look the same as all other block statements and it
makes them stand out clearly in the program text. This rule of thumb
is only dropped in very simple examples like:
@cindex Style
@smallexample

if (i == 0) i++;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The @code{if} statement alone allows only a very limited kind of
decision: it makes do or don't decisions; it could not decide for the
traveller whether to take the left fork or the right fork of his road,
for instance, it could only tell him whether to get up and go at
all. To do much more for programs it needs to be extended. This is the
purpose of the @code{else} statement, described after some example
listings.

@section @code{if} ... @code{else}

The @samp{if ... else} statement has the form:
@smallexample

if (@var{condition}) @var{statement1}; else @var{statement2};

@end smallexample
@noindent
This is most often written in the compound statement form:
@smallexample

if (@var{condition})
   @{
   @var{statements}
   @}
else
   @{
   @var{statements}
   @}

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
The @samp{if ... else} statement is a two way
branch: it means do one thing or the other. When it is executed, the
condition is evaluated and if it has the value `true' (i.e. not zero)
then @var{statement1} is executed. If the condition is `false' (or
zero) then @var{statement2} is executed. The @samp{if ... else}
construction often saves an unnecessary test from having to be
made. For instance:
@smallexample

int i;

scanf ("%ld",i);

if (i > 0)
   @{
   printf ("That number was positive!");
   @}
else
   @{
   printf ("That number was negative or zero!");
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
It is not necessary to test whether @code{i} was negative in the second
block because it was implied by the @samp{if ... else} structure. That is,
that block would not have been executed unless @code{i} were NOT greater
than zero.  The weary traveller above might make a decision such as:
@smallexample

if (rightleg > leftleg)
   @{
   take_left_branch();
   @}
else
   @{
   take_right_branch();

      @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Both of these test @code{i} for the same information, but they do it in
different ways. The first method might have been born out of the following
sequence of thought:

@image{img/17.2,12cm}

@itemize -
If @code{i} is greater than 2 and @code{i} is less than four, both at
the same time, then @code{i} has to be 3.
@end itemize
@noindent
The second method is more complicated. Think carefully. It says:
@itemize -
If @code{i} is greater than 2, do what is in the curly braces.
Inside these curly braces @code{i} is always greater than 2
because otherwise the program would never have arrived
inside them. Now, if @code{i} is also less than 4, then do what is
inside the new curly braces. Inside these curly braces @code{i}
is always less than 4. But wait! The whole of the second
test is held inside the "@code{i} is greater than 2" braces, which
is a sealed capsule: nothing else can get in, so,
if the program gets into the "@code{i} is less than 4" braces
as well, then both facts must be true at the same time.
There is only one integer which is bigger than 2 and less
than 4 at the same time: it is 3. So @code{i} is 3.
@end itemize

The aim of this demonstration is to show that there are two ways
of making multiple decisions in C. Using the logical comparison
operators @code{&&} (AND) @code{||} (OR) several multiple
tests can be made. In many cases though it is too difficult to think
in terms of these operators and the sealed capsule idea begins to look
attractive. This is another advantage of using the curly braces: it
helps the programmer to see that if statements and @samp{if ... else} statements
are made up of sealed capsule parts. Once inside a sealed capsule
@smallexample

if (i > 2)
   @{
   /* i is greater than 2 in here! */
   @}
else 
   @{
   /* i is not greater than 2 here! */
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
the programmer can rest assured that nothing illegal can get in. The
block braces are like regions of grace: they cannot be penetrated by
anything which does not satisfy the right conditions. This is an
enormous weight off the mind! The programmer can sit back and think:
I have accepted that i is greater than 2 inside these braces, so I can
stop worrying about that now. This is how programmers learn to think
in a structured way. They learn to be satisfied that certain things
have already been proven and thus save themselves from the onset of
madness as the ideas become too complex to think of all in one go.

The answer is that the second of these programs can be more efficient.
This is because it uses the @code{else} form of the @code{if} statement
which in turn means that fewer things have to be calculated. Program one
makes every single test, because the program meets every if statement,
one after the other. The second program does not necessarily do this
however. The nested @code{if} statements make sure that the second two
tests are only made if the first one failed. Similarly the third test is
only performed if the first two failed. So the second program could end
up doing a third of the work of the first program, in the best possible
case. Nesting decisions like this can be an efficient way of controlling
long lists of decisions like those above. Nested decisions make a program
branch into lots of possible paths, but choosing one path would preclude
others.

@node switch, Example 15, Stringing together if ... else, Decisions
@section @code{switch}: integers and characters

The @code{switch} construction is another way of making a program path
branch into lots of different limbs. It can be used as a different way
of writing a string of @samp{if ... else} statements, but it is more versatile
than that and it only works for integers and character type values. It
works like a kind of multi-way switch. (See the diagram.) The switch
statement has the following form:
@cindex switch case
@cindex case statement
@smallexample

switch (@var{int or char expression})
   @{
   case @var{constant} : @var{statement};
                   break;          /* optional */
   ...
   @}

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
It has an expression which is evaluated
and a number of constant `cases' which are to be chosen from, each of
which is followed by a statement or compound statement. An extra
statement called @code{break} can also be incorporated into the block
at any point. @code{break} is a reserved word.

@image{img/17.3,12cm}

The switch statement can be written more specifically for integers:
@smallexample

switch (@var{integer value})

   @{
   case 1:  @var{statement1};
            break;                /* optional line */

   case 2:  @var{statement2};
            break;                /* optional line */

   ...

   default: @var{default statement}
            break;                 /* optional line */
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
When a switch statement is encountered, the expression in the parentheses
is evaluated and the program checks to see whether the result of that
expression matches any of the constants labelled with @code{case}. If a
match is made (for instance, if the expression is evaluated to 23 and
there is a statement beginning "case 23 : ...")  execution will start
just after that case statement and will carry on until either the
closing brace @code{@}} is encountered or a break statement is
found. @code{break} is a handy way of jumping straight out of the switch
block. One of the cases is called @code{default}. Statements which
follow the @code{default} case are executed for all cases which are not
specifically listed.  @code{switch} is a way of choosing some action
from a number of known instances. Look at the following example.

   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The program selects one of the printf statements using a switch
construction. At every @code{case} in the switch, a @code{break}
statement is used. This causes control to jump straight out of the
switch statement to its closing brace @code{@}}. If break were not
included it would go right on executing the statements to the end. break gives a way of jumping out of a switch quickly.

There might be cases where it is not necessary or not desirable to jump
out of the switch immediately. Think of a function @code{yes()} which
gets a character from the user and tests whether it was 'y' or 'Y'.
@smallexample

#define TRUE  1
#define FALSE 0

yes ()         /* A sloppy but simple function */

@{
switch (getchar())
   @{
   case 'y' :
   case 'Y' : return TRUE
   default  : return FALSE
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
If the character is either 'y' or 'Y' then the function meets the
statement @code{return TRUE.} If there had been a break statement after
case 'y' then control would not have been able to reach case 'Y' as
well. The return statement does more than break out of switch, it
breaks out of the whole function, so in this case break was not
required. The default option ensures that whatever else the character
is, the function returns false.

@cindex Loops
Decisions can also be used to make up loops. Loops free a program
from the straitjacket of doing things only once. They allow the
programmer to build a sequence of instructions which can be executed
again and again, with some condition deciding when they will stop.
There are three kinds of loop in C. They are called:

@itemize @bullet
@item 
@code{while}
@item
@code{do} ... @code{while}
@item
@code{for}
@end itemize

@noindent
These three loops offer a great amount of flexibility to
programmers and can be used in some surprising ways!

@node while, Example 16, Loops, Loops
@section @code{while}

The simplest of the three loops is the while loop. In common language
@code{while} has a fairly obvious meaning: the @code{while}-loop has a
condition:
@cindex while loop
@smallexample

while (@var{condition})
   @{
   @var{statements};
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
and the statements in the curly braces are executed while the
condition has the value "true" ( 1 ). There are dialects of English,
however, in which "while" does not have its commonplace meaning, so it
is worthwhile explaining the steps which take place in a while loop.

@image{img/18.1,12cm}

The first important thing about this loop is that has a
conditional expression (something like @code{(a > b)} etc). which is
evaluated every time the loop is executed by the computer. If the
value of the expression is true, then it will carry on with the
instructions in the curly braces. If the expression evaluates to
@code{false} (or 0) then the instructions in the braces are ignored and the
entire while loop ends. The computer then moves onto the next
statement in the program.

The second thing to notice about this loop is that the conditional
expression comes at the start of the loop: this means that the condition
is tested at the start of every `pass', not at the end. The reason that
this is important is this: if the condition has the value false before
the loop has been executed even once, the statements inside the braces
will not get executed at all -- not even once.

The best way to illustrate a loop is to give an example of its use. One
example was sneaked into an earlier chapter before its time, in order to
write the @code{skipgarb()} function which complemented
@code{scanf()}. That was:
@smallexample

skipgarb ()             /* skip garbage corrupting scanf */

@{
while (getchar() != '\n')
   @{
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This is a slightly odd use of the while loop which is pure C, through
and through. It is one instance in which the programmer has to start
thinking C and not any other language. Something which is immediately
obvious from listing is that the while loop in @code{skipgarb()} is empty: it
contains no statements. This is quite valid: the loop will merely do
nothing a certain number of times ... at least it would do nothing if
it were not for the assignment in the conditional expression! It could
also be written:
@smallexample

skipgarb ()             /* skip garbage corrupting scanf */

@{
while (getchar() != '\n')
   @{
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The assignment inside the conditional expression makes this loop
special. What happens is the following. When the loop is encountered,
the computer attempts to evaluate the expression inside the
parentheses. There, inside the parentheses, it finds a function call to
@code{getchar()}, so it calls @code{getchar()} which fetches the next
character from the input. @code{getchar()} then takes on the value of
the character which it fetched from the input file. Next the computer
finds the @code{!=} "is not equal to" symbol and the newline character
@code{\n}. This means that there is a comparison to be made. The
computer compares the character fetched by @code{getchar()} with the
newline character and if they are `not equal' the expression is true. If
they are equal the expression is false. Now, if the expression is true,
the while statement will loop and start again -- and it will evaluate
the expression on every pass of the loop to check whether or not it is
true. When the expression eventually becomes false the loop will
quit. The net result of this subtlety is that @code{skipgarb()} skips all
the input characters up to and including the next newline @samp{\n}
character and that usually means the rest of the input.

@node Example 16, Example 17, while, Loops
@section Example Listing

Another use of while is to write a better function called
@code{yes()}. The idea of this function was introduced in the previous
section. It uses a while loop which is always true to repeat the
process of getting a response from the user. When the response is
either yes or no it quits using the @code{return} function to jump right
out of the loop.

@cindex do while
The @code{do} ... @code{while} 
loop resembles most closely the repeat ... until loops
of Pascal and BASIC except that it is the `logical opposite'. The
do loop has the form:
@smallexample

do
   @{
   @var{statements};
   @}

while (@var{condition})

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice that the condition is at the end of this loop. This means that a
@code{do ... while} loop will always be executed at least once, before the
test is made to determine whether it should continue. This is the only
difference between @code{while} and @code{do ... while}.

A @code{do ... while} loop is like the "repeat ... until" of other languages
in the following sense: if the condition is NOTed using the @samp{!}
operator, then the two are identical.
@smallexample

@var{repeat}                   do

                   ==

@node for, The flexible for loop, Example 18, Loops
@section @code{for}

The most interesting and also the most difficult of all the loops
is the for loop. The name @code{for} is a hangover from earlier days and
other languages. It is not altogether appropriate for C's version of
@code{for}. The name comes from the typical description of a classic for
loop:

@itemize -
For all values of @var{variable} from @var{value1} to
 @var{value2} in steps of @code{value3}, repeat the
 following sequence of commands ...

@end itemize
@noindent
In BASIC this looks like:
@smallexample

FOR @var{variable} = @var{value1} TO @var{value2} STEP @var{value3}

NEXT @var{variable}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The C for loop is much more versatile than its BASIC counterpart;
it is actually based upon the @code{while} construction. A @code{for} loop
normally has the characteristic feature of controlling one particular
variable, called the control variable. That variable is somehow
associated with the loop. For example it might be a variable which is
used to count "for values from 0 to 10" or whatever.
The form of the for loop is:
@smallexample

for (@var{statement1}; @var{condition}; @var{statement2})
   @{
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
For normal usage, these expressions have the following significance.

@table @var
@item statement1
   This is some kind of expression which
             initializes the control variable.
             This statement is only carried out once before
             the start of the loop.
             e.g. @code{i = 0;}

@item condition
    This is a condition which behaves like the
             while loop. The condition is evaluated at the
             beginning of every loop and the loop is only
             carried out while this expression is true.
             e.g. @code{i < 20;}

@item statement2
   This is some kind of expression for altering
             the value of the control variable. In languages
             such as Pascal this always means adding or 
             subtracting 1 from the variable. In C it can
             be absolutely anything.
             e.g. @code{i++} or @code{i *= 20} or @code{i /= 2.3} ...
@end table

@noindent
Compare a C for loop to the BASIC for loop. Here is an example in
which the loop counts from 0 to 10 in steps of 0.5:
@smallexample

FOR X = 0 TO 10 STEP 0.5

NEXT X


for (x = 0; x <= 10; x += 0.5)
   @{
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The C translation looks peculiar in comparison because it works
on a subtly different principle. It does not contain information about
when it will stop, as the BASIC one does, instead it contains
information about when it should be looping. The result is that a C
for loop often has the @code{<=} symbol in it.
The for loop has plenty of uses. It could be used to find the sum
of the first n natural numbers very simply:
@smallexample

sum = 0;

for (i = 0; i <= n; i++)
   @{
   sum += i;
   @}

@end smallexample
It generally finds itself useful in applications where a single
variable has to be controlled in a well determined way.

@node The flexible for loop, Quitting Loops and Hurrying Them Up!, for, Loops
@section The flexible for loop

The word `statement' was chosen carefully, above, to describe
what goes into a for loop. Look at the loop again:
@smallexample

for (@var{statement1}; @var{condition}; @var{statement2})
   @{
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Statement really means what it says. C will accept any statement in
the place of those above, including the empty statement. The while
loop could be written as a for loop!
@smallexample

for (; condition; )    /* while ?? */
   @{
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Here there are two empty statements, which are just wasted. This
flexibility can be put to better uses though. Consider the following
loop:
@smallexample

for (x = 2; x <= 1000; x = x * x)
   @{
     ...
   @}

@end smallexample
This loop begins from 2 and each time the statements in the braces are
executed @code{x} squares itself! Another odd looking loop is the following
one:
@smallexample

for (ch = '*'; ch != '\n'; ch = getchar())
   @{
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This could be used to make yet another different kind of @code{skipgarb()}
function. The loop starts off by initializing @code{ch} with a star
character. It checks that @code{ch != '\n'} (which it isn't, first time
around) and proceeds with the loop. On each new pass, @code{ch} is reassigned
by calling the function @code{getchar()}.
It is also possible to combine several incremental commands in a loop:
@smallexample

for (i = 0, j=10; i < j; i++, j--)
   @{
   printf("i = %d, j= %d\n",i,j);
   @}

@end smallexample

@var{Statement2} can be any statement at all which the programmer would
like to be executed on every pass of the loop. Why not put that
statement in the curly braces? In most cases that would be the best
thing to do, but in special instances it might keep a program tidier or
more readable to put it in a for loop instead. There is no good rule for
when to do this, except to say: make your code as clear as possible.

It is not only the statements which are flexible. An unnerving
feature of the for construction (according to some programmers) is
that even the conditional expression in the for loop can be altered by
the program from within the loop itself if it is written as a variable.
@smallexample

int i, number = 20;

for (i = 0; i <= number; i++)
   @{
   if (i == 9) 
      @{
      number = 30;
      @}
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This is so nerve shattering that many languages forbid it outright. To
be sure, it is not often a very good idea to use this facility, but in
the right hands, it is a powerful one to have around.

@node Quitting Loops and Hurrying Them Up!, Nested Loops, The flexible for loop, Loops
@section Quitting Loops and Hurrying Them Up!

C provides a simple way of
jumping out of any of the three loops above at any stage, whether it
has finished or not. The statement which performs this action is the
same statement which was used to jump out of @code{switch} statements in
the previous chapter.
@smallexample

  break;

@end smallexample
@noindent
If this statement is encountered a loop will quit where it stands. For
instance, an expensive way of assigning @code{i} to be 12 would be:
@smallexample

for (i = 1; i <= 20; i++)
   @{
   if (i == 12)
      @{
      break;
      @}
   @}

@end smallexample
Still another way of making @code{skipgarb()} would be to perform the
following loop:
@smallexample

while (TRUE)
   @{
   ch = getchar();
   if (ch == '\n')
      @{
      break;
      @}
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Of course, another way to do this would be to use the @code{return()}
statement, which jumps right out of a whole function. @code{break} only
jumps out of the loop, so it is less drastic.

As well as wanting to quit a loop, a programmer might want to
hurry a loop on to the next pass: perhaps to avoid executing a lot of
irrelevant statements, for instance. C gives a statement for this too,
called:
@smallexample

       continue;

@end smallexample
@noindent
When a @code{continue} statement is encountered, a loop will stop whatever it
is doing and will go straight to the start of the next loop pass. This
might be useful to avoid dividing by zero in a program:
@smallexample

for (i = -10; i <= 10; i++)
   @{
   if (i == 0)
      @{
      continue;
      @}
   printf ("%d", 20/i);
   @}

@end smallexample

@node Nested Loops, Questions 17, Quitting Loops and Hurrying Them Up!, Loops
@section Nested Loops

Like decisions, loops will also nest: that is, loops can be
placed inside other loops. Although this feature will work with any
loop at all, it is most commonly used with the for loop, because this
is easiest to control. The idea of nested loops is important for
multi-dimensional arrays which are examined in the next chapter. A
@code{for} loop controls the number of times that a particular set of
statements will be carried out. Another outer loop could be used
to control the number of times that a whole loop is carried out. To
see the benefit of nesting loops, the example below shows how a square
could be printed out using two @code{printf} statements and two loops.

@smallexample

/*****************************************/

@cindex Arrays
@cindex Tables
Arrays are a convenient way of grouping a lot of variables under
a single variable name. Arrays are like pigeon holes or chess boards,
with each compartment or square acting as a storage place; they can be
one dimensional, two dimensional or more dimensional!
An array is defined using square brackets @code{[]}. For example: an
array of three integers called "triplet" would be declared like this:
@smallexample

     int triplet[3];

@end smallexample
@noindent
This statement would cause space for three integer
type variables to be created in memory next to each other as in the
diagram below.

@smallexample

                 ------------------------------------
int triplet:    |           |           |            |
                 ------------------------------------


@end smallexample
@noindent
The number in the square brackets of the declaration is referred
to as the `index' (plural: indicies) or `subscript' of the array and
it must be an integer number between 0 and (in this case) 2. The three
integers are called elements of the array and they are referred to in
a program by writing:
@smallexample

triplet[0]
triplet[1]
triplet[2]

@end smallexample
@noindent
Note that the indicies start at zero and run up to one less than the
number which is placed in the declaration (which is called the
dimension of the array.) The reason for this will become clear
later. Also notice that every element in an array is of the same type
as every other. It is not (at this stage) possible to have arrays
which contain many different data types. When arrays are declared
inside a function, storage is allocated for them, but that storage
space is not initialized: that is, the memory space contains garbage
(random values). It is usually necessary, therefore, to initialize the
array before the program truly begins, to prepare it for use. This
usually means that all the elements in the array will be set to zero.

@section Why use arrays?

Arrays are most useful when they have a large number of elements:
that is, in cases where it would be completely impractical to have a
different name for every storage space in the memory. It is then
highly beneficial to move over to arrays for storing information for
two reasons:
@itemize @bullet
@item   The storage spaces in arrays have indicies. These
     numbers can often be related to variables in a 
     problem and so there is a logical connection to be
     made between an array and a program.

@item    In C, arrays can be initialized very easily indeed.
     It is far easier to initialize an array than it is to
     initialize twenty or so variables.
@end itemize

The first of these reasons is probably the most important one, as
far as C is concerned, since information can be stored in other ways
with equally simple initialization facilities in C.
One example of the use of an array might be in taking a census of
the types of car passing on a road. By defining macros for the names
of the different cars, they could easily be linked to the elements in
an array.
@smallexample

Type      Array Element

car            0
auto           1
bil            2

@end smallexample
@noindent
The array could then be used to store the number of cars of a given
type which had driven past. e.g.
@smallexample

/***********************************************/
/*                                             */
/* Census                                      */
/*                                             */
/***********************************************/

#include <stdio.h>

#define NOTFINISHED 1
#define CAR         0
#define AUTO        1
#define BIL         2

/************************************************/

main ()

@{ int type[3];
   int index;

for (index = 0; index < 3; index++)
   @{
   type[index] = 0;
   @}

while (NOTFINISHED)
   @{
   printf ("Enter type number 0,1, or 2");
   scanf ("%d", &index);
   skipgarb();

   type[index] += 1;       /* See text below */
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This program, first of all, initializes the elements of the array to
be zero. It then enters a loop which repeatedly fetches a number from
the user and increases the value stored in the array element, labelled
by that number, by 1. The effect is to count the cars as they go
past. This program is actually not a very good program for two reasons
in particular:
@itemize @bullet
@item  Firstly, it does not check that the number which the
     user typed is actually one of the elements of the
     array. (See the section below about this.)

@item  The loop goes on for ever and the program never
     gives up the information which it stores. In short:
     it is not very useful.
@end itemize
Another example, which comes readily to mind, would be the use of
a two dimensional array for storing the positions of chess pieces in a
chess game. Two dimensional arrays have a structure like that of a chess board
already and they require two numbers (two indicies) to pinpoint a
particular storage cell. This is just like the coordinates of squares on a chess
board, so there is an immediate and logical connection between an
array and the problem of keeping track of the pieces on a chess board.
Arrays play an important role in the handling of string
variables. Strings are important enough to have a chapter of their
own, @xref{Strings}.

@node Limits and The Dimension of an array, Arrays and for loops, Why use arrays?, Arrays
@section Limits and The Dimension of an array

C does not do much hand holding. It is invariably up to the programmer
to make sure that programs are free from errors. This is especially true
with arrays. C does not complain if you try to write to elements of an
array which do not exist! For example:
@smallexample

char array[5];

@end smallexample
@noindent
is an array with 5 elements. If you wrote:
@smallexample

array[7] = '*';

@end smallexample
C would happily try to write the character @samp{*} at the location which
would have corresponded to the seventh element, had it been declared
that way. Unfortunately this would probably be memory taken up by some
other variable or perhaps even by the operating system. The result
would be either:
@itemize @bullet
@item  The value in the incorrect memory location would
     be corrupted with unpredictable consequences.

@item   The value would corrupt the memory and crash the
   program completely!  On Unix systems this leads to
a memory @emph{segmentation fault}.

@end itemize 
@noindent 
The second of
these tends to be the result on operating systems with proper memory
protection.  Writing over the bounds of an array is a common source of
error. Remember that the array limits run from zero to the size of the
array minus one.

@node Arrays and for loops, Example 19, Limits and The Dimension of an array, Arrays
@section Arrays and for loops

Arrays have a natural partner in programs: the for loop. The @code{for} loop
provides a simple way of counting through the numbers of an index in a
controlled way.  Consider a one dimensional array called @code{array}. A for
loop can be used to initialize the array, so that all its elements
contain zero:
@smallexample

#define SIZE  10;

main ()

@{ int i, array[SIZE];

for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
   @{
   array[i] = 0;
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
It could equally well be used to fill the array with different
values. Consider:
@smallexample

#define SIZE  10;

main ()

@{ int i, array[size];

for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
   @{
   array[i] = i;
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This fills each successive space with the number of its index:
@smallexample

index        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9

            ---------------------------------------
element    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
contents    ---------------------------------------

@end smallexample
@noindent
The @code{for} loop can be used to work on an array sequentially at any time
during a program, not only when it is being initialized. The example
listing below shows an example of how this might work for a one
dimensional array, called an Eratosthenes sieve. This sieve is an
array which is used for weeding out prime numbers, that is: numbers
which cannot be divided by any number except 1 without leaving a
remainder or a fraction. It works by filling an array with numbers
from 0 to some maximum value in the same way that was shown above and
then by going through the numbers in turn and deleting (setting equal
to zero) every multiple of every number from the array. This
eliminates all the numbers which could be divided by something exactly
and leaves only the prime numbers at the end. Try to follow the
listing below.

@cindex Multidimensional arrays
There is no limit, in principle, to the number of indicies which
an array can have. (Though there is a limit to the amount of memory
available for their storage.) An array of two dimensions could be
declared as follows:
@smallexample

float numbers[SIZE][SIZE];

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{SIZE} is some constant. (The sizes of the two dimensions do not
have to be the same.) This is called a two dimensional array because
it has two indicies, or two labels in square brackets. It has (@code{SIZE} *
@code{SIZE}) or size-squared elements in it, which form an imaginary grid,
like a chess board, in which every square is a variable or storage
area.
@smallexample

------------------------------------
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | ... (up to SIZE)
------------------------------------
| 1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

| 2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

@end smallexample

Every element in this grid needs two indicies to pin-point
it. The elements are accessed by giving the coordinates of the element
in the grid. For instance to set the element 2,3 to the value 12, one
would write:
@smallexample

array[2][3] = 12;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The usual terminology for the two indicies is that the first gives the
row number in the grid and that the second gives the column number in
the grid. (Rows go along, columns hold up the ceiling.)
An array cannot be stored in the memory as a grid: computer
memory is a one dimensional thing. Arrays are therefore stored in
rows. The following array:
@smallexample

------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
------------
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
------------
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
------------

@end smallexample
@noindent
would be stored:
@smallexample

------------------------------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
------------------------------------
*  ROW #1  *  ROW #2  *  ROW #3   * 

@end smallexample
@noindent
Another way of saying that arrays are stored row-wise is to say that
the second index varies fastest, because a two-dimensional array is
always thought of as ...
@smallexample

    array[row][column]

@end smallexample
@noindent
so for every row stored, there will be lots of columns inside that
row. That means the column index goes from 0 to @code{SIZE} inside every row,
so it is changing faster as the line of storage is followed.

A three dimensional array, like a cube or a cuboid, could also be
defined in the same kind of way:
@smallexample

double cube[SIZE][SIZE][SIZE];

@end smallexample
@noindent
or with different limits on each dimension:
@smallexample

short  notcubic[2][6][8];

@end smallexample
@noindent
Three dimensional arrays are stored according to the same pattern as
two dimensional arrays. They are kept in computer memory as a linear
sequence of variable stores and the last index is always the one which
varies fastest.

@node Arrays and Nested Loops, Example 20, Arrays Of More Than One Dimension, Arrays
@section Arrays and Nested Loops

Arrays of more than one dimension are usually handled by nested
for loops. A two dimensional array might be initialized in the
following way:
@smallexample

main ()

@{ int i,j;
  float array[SIZE1][SIZE2];

for (i = 0; i < SIZE1; i++)
   @{
   for (j = 0; j < SIZE2; j++)
      @{
      array[i][j] = 0;
      @}
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
In three dimensions, three nested loops would be needed:
@smallexample

main ()

@{ int i,j,k;
  float array[SIZE1][SIZE2][SIZE3];

for (i = 0; i < SIZE1; i++)
   @{
   for (j = 0; j < SIZE2; j++)
      @{
      for (k = 0; k < SIZE3; k++)
         @{
         array[i][j][k] = 0;
         @}
      @}
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
An example program helps to show how this happens in practice. The
example below demonstrates the so-called "Game of Life". The aim is to
mimic something like cell reproduction by applying some rigid rules to a
pattern of dots @samp{.} and stars @samp{*}. A dot is a place where
there is no life (as we know it!) and a star is a place in which there
is a living thing. The rules will be clear from the listing. Things to
notice are the way the program traverses the arrays and the way in which
it checks that it is not overstepping the boundaries of the arrays.

@node Initializing Arrays, Arrays and Pointers, Output of Game of Life, Arrays
@section Initializing Arrays

Arrays can be initialized in two ways. The first way is by
assigning every element to some value with a statement like:
@smallexample

array[2] = 42;
array[3] = 12;

@end smallexample
@noindent
or perhaps with the aid of one or more for loops. Because it is
tedious, to say the least, not to mention uneconomical, to initialize
the values of each element to a different value, C provides another
method, which employs a single assignment operator @samp{=} and curly
braces @code{@{} @code{@}}.
@emph{This method only works for static variables and external variables.}

@cindex Initialization of arrays
@cindex Static initialization of arrays
Recall that arrays are stored row-wise or with the last index
varying fastest. A 3 by 3 array could be initialized in the following
way:
@smallexample

static int array[3][3] =

@{
 @{10,23,42@},
 @{1,654,0@},
 @{40652,22,0@}
@};

@end smallexample
@noindent
The internal braces are unnecessary, but help to distinguish the rows
from the columns. The same thing could be written:
@smallexample

int array[3][3] =

@{
10,23,42,
1,654,0
40652,22,0
@};

@end smallexample
@noindent
Take care to include the semicolon at the end of the curly brace which
closes the assignment.

Note that, if there are not enough elements in the curly braces
to account for every single element in an array, the remaining
elements will be filled out with zeros. Static variables are always
guaranteed to be initialized to zero anyway, whereas auto or local
variables are guaranteed to be garbage: this is because static storage
is created by the compiler in the body of a program, whereas auto or
local storage is created at run time.

@node Arrays and Pointers, Arrays as Parameters, Initializing Arrays, Arrays
@section Arrays and Pointers

The information about how arrays are stored was not included just
for interest. There is another way of looking at arrays which follows
the BCPL idea of an array as simply a block of memory. An array can be
accessed with pointers as well as with @code{[]} square brackets.
 
@emph{The name of an array variable, standing alone, is actually a
pointer to the first element in the array.}

For example: if an array is declared
@smallexample

float numbers[34];

@end smallexample
then @code{numbers} is a pointer to the first floating point number in the
array; @code{numbers} is a pointer in its own right. (In this case it is
type `pointer to @code{float}'.) So the first element of the array could be
accessed by writing:
@smallexample

numbers[0] = 22.3;

@end smallexample
@noindent
or by writing
@smallexample

*numbers = 22.3;

@end smallexample
@noindent
For character arrays, which are dealt with in some depth in chapter
20, this gives an alternative way of getting at the elements in the
array.
@smallexample

char arrayname[5];
char *ptr;

for (ptr = arrayname; ptr <= arrayname+4; ptr++)
   @{
   *ptr = 0;
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The code above sets the array @code{arrayname} to zero. This method of
getting at array data is not recommended by this author except in very
simple computer environments. If a program is running on a normal
microcomputer, then there should be few problems with this alternative
method of handling arrays. On the other hand, if the microcomputer is
multi-tasking, or the program is running on a larger system which has
a limited manager, then memory ceases to be something which can be
thought of as a sequence of boxes standing next to one another. A
multi-tasking system shares memory with other programs and it takes
what it can find, where it can find it. The upshot of this is that it
is not possible to guarantee that arrays will be stored in one simple
string of memory locations: it might be scattered around in different
places. So
@smallexample

ptr = arrayname + 4;

@end smallexample
@noindent
might not be a pointer to the fifth character in a character
array. This could be found instead using the @samp{&} operator. A pointer to
the fifth element can be reliably found with:
@smallexample

ptr = &(arrayname[4]);

@end smallexample
@noindent
Be warned!

@node Arrays as Parameters, Questions 18, Arrays and Pointers, Arrays
@section Arrays as Parameters

What happens if we want to pass an array as a
parameter? Does the program copy the entire array into local storage?
The answer is no because it would be a waste of time and
memory. Arrays can be passed as parameters, but only as variable
ones. This is a simple matter, because the name of the array is a
pointer to the array. The Game of Life program above does this. Notice
from that program how the declarations for the parameters are made.

There is an important distinction between a string and a single
character in C. The convention is that single characters are enclosed
by single quotes e.g. @samp{*} and have the type char. Strings, on the
other hand, are enclosed by double quotes e.g. @code{"string ..."} and have the type
"pointer to char" @samp{(char *)} or array of char. Here are some
declarations for strings which are given without immediate
explanations.

@section Strings, Arrays and Pointers

A string is really an array of characters. It is stored at some
place in the memory and is given an end marker which standard library
functions can recognize as being the end of the string. The end marker
is called the zero (or @code{NULL}) byte because it is just a byte which
contains the value zero: @samp{\0}. Programs rarely get to see
this end marker as most functions which handle strings use it or add
it automatically.

Strings can be declared in two main ways; one of these is as an
array of characters, the other is as a pointer to some pre-assigned
array. Perhaps the simplest way of seeing how C stores arrays is to give
an extreme example which would probably never be used in
practice. Think of how a string called @code{string} might be used to store the message "Tedious!". The fact that a string is an array
of characters might lead you to write something like:
@smallexample

#define LENGTH 9;

main ()

@{ char string[LENGTH]; 

string[0] = 'T';
string[1] = 'e';
string[2] = 'd';
string[3] = 'i';
string[4] = 'o';
string[5] = 'u';
string[6] = 's';
string[7] = '!';
string[8] = '\0';

printf ("%s", string);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This method of handling strings is perfectly acceptable, if there is
time to waste, but it is so laborious that C provides a special
initialization service for strings, which bypasses the need to assign
every single character with a new assignment!. There are six ways of
assigning constant strings to arrays. (A constant string is one which
is actually typed into the program, not one which is typed in by the
user.) They are written into a short compilable program below. The
explanation follows.

@smallexample

@end smallexample
@noindent
The details of what goes on with strings can be difficult to get to
grips with. It is a good idea to revise pointers and arrays before
reading the explanations below. Notice the diagrams too: they are
probably more helpful than words.

The first of these assignments is a global, static variable.
More correctly, it is a pointer to a global, static array. Static
variables are assigned storage space in the body of a program when the
compiler creates the executable code. This means that they are saved
on disk along with the program code, so they can be initialized at
compile time. That is the reason for the rule which says that only
static arrays can be initialized with a constant expression in a
declaration. The first statement allocates space for a pointer to an
array. Notice that, because the string which is to be assigned to it,
is typed into the program, the compiler can also allocate space for
that in the executable file too. In fact the compiler stores the
string, adds a zero byte to the end of it and assigns a pointer to its
first character to the variable called @code{global_string1}.

The second statement works almost identically, with the exception
that, this time the compiler sees the declaration of a static array,
which is to be initialized. Notice that there is no size declaration
in the square brackets. This is quite legal in fact: the compiler
counts the number of characters in the initialization string and
allocates just the right amount of space, filling the string into that
space, along with its end marker as it goes. Remember also that the
name of the array is a pointer to the first character, so, in fact,
the two methods are identical.

The third expression is the same kind of thing, only this time,
the declaration is inside the function @code{main()} so the type is not
static but auto. The difference between this and the other two
declarations is that this pointer variable is created every time the
function @code{main()} is called. It is new each time and the same thing
holds for any other function which it might have been defined in: when
the function is called, the pointer is created and when it ends, it is
destroyed. The string which initializes it is stored in the executable
file of the program (because it is typed into the text).  The compiler
returns a value which is a pointer to the string's first character and
uses that as a value to initialize the pointer with. This is a
slightly round about way of defining the string constant. The normal
thing to do would be to declare the string pointer as being static,
but this is just a matter of style. In fact this is what is done in
the fourth example.

The fifth example is again identical, in practice to other static
types, but is written as an `open' array with an unspecified size.

The sixth example is forbidden! The reason for this might seem
rather trivial, but it is made in the interests of efficiency. The
array declared is of type auto: this means that the whole array is
created when the function is called and destroyed
afterwards. auto-arrays cannot be initialized with a string 
because they would have to be re-initialized every
time the array were created: that is, each time the function were
called. The final example could be used to overcome this, if the
programmer were inclined to do so. Here an auto array of characters is
declared (with a size this time, because there is nothing for the
compiler to count the size of). There is no single assignment which
will fill this array with a string though: the programmer would have
to do it character by character so that the inefficiency is made as
plain as possible!

@node Arrays of Strings, Example 21, Strings Arrays and Pointers, Strings
@section Arrays of Strings

In the previous chapter we progressed from one dimensional arrays to
two dimensional arrays, or arrays of arrays! The same thing works well
for strings which are declared static. Programs can take advantage of
C's easy assignment facilities to let the compiler count the size of
the string arrays and define arrays of messages. For example here is a
program which prints out a menu for an application program:

@smallexample

/*********************************************************/

/*********************************************************/

   " |           ~~~~~~~~~~~~               |\n",
   " |     (1) Edit Defaults                |\n",
   " |     (2) Print Charge Sheet           |\n",

   " |                                      |\n",
   "  -------------------------------------- \n"
   @};
return (t[n]);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice the way in which the static declaration works. It is
initialized once at compile time, so there is effectively only one
statement in this function and that is the return statement. This
function retains the pointer information from call to call.
The Morse code program could be rewritten more
economically using static strings, @xref{Example 15}.

@node Strings from the user, Handling strings, Example 21, Strings
@section Strings from the user

All the strings mentioned so far have been typed into a program by the
programmer and stored in a program file, so it has not been necessary to
worry about where they were stored. Often though we would like to fetch
a string from the user and store it somewhere in the memory for later
use. It might even be necessary to get a whole bunch of strings and
store them all. But how will the program know in advance how much array
space to allocate to these strings? The answer is that it won't, but
that it doesn't matter at all!

One way of getting a simple, single string from the user is to
define an array and to read the characters one by one. An example of
this was the Game of Life program in the previous chapter:
@itemize @bullet
@item Define the array to be a certain size

@item Check that the user does not type in too many characters.

@item Use the string in that array.

@end itemize
@noindent
Another way is to define a static string with an initializer as
in the following example. The function @code{filename()} asks the user to
type in a filename, for loading or saving by and return it to a
calling function.
@smallexample

char *filename()

@{ static char *filenm = "........................";

do
   @{
   printf ("Enter filename :");
   scanf ("%24s",filenm);
   skipgarb();
   @}
while (strlen(filenm) == 0);
return (filenm);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The string is made static and given an initializing expression and
this forces the compiler to make some space for the string. It makes
exactly 24 characters plus a zero byte in the program file, which can
be used by an application. Notice that the conversion string in scanf
prevents the characters from spilling over the bounds of the
string. The function @code{strlen()} is a standard library function which is
described below; it returns the length of a string. @code{skipgarb()} is
the function which was introduced in chapter 15.

Neither of the methods above is any good if a program is going to
be fetching a lot of strings from a user. It just isn't practical to
define lots of static strings and expect the user to type into the
right size boxes! The next step in string handling is therefore to
allocate memory for strings personally: in other words to be able to
say how much storage is needed for a string while a program is
running. C has special memory allocation functions which can do this,
not only for strings but for any kind of object.
Suppose then that a program is going to get ten strings from the
user. Here is one way in which it could be done:
@enumerate
@item
 Define one large, static string (or array) for getting
     one string at a time. Call this a string buffer, or
     waiting place.

@item
 Define an array of ten pointers to characters, so that
     the strings can be recalled easily.

@item
 Find out how long the string in the string buffer is.

@item
 Allocate memory for the string.

@item
 Copy the string from the buffer to the new storage and
     place a pointer to it in the array of pointers for
     reference.

@item
   Release the memory when it is finished with.

@end enumerate

The function which allocates memory in C is called
@code{malloc()} and it works like this:

@itemize @bullet
@item   @code{malloc()} should be declared as returning the type
     pointer to character, with the statement:
@smallexample

  char *malloc();

@end smallexample

@item    @code{malloc()} takes one argument which should be an unsigned
     integer value telling the function how many bytes of
     storage to allocate. It returns a pointer to the
     first memory location in that storage:
@smallexample

  char *ptr;
  unsigned int size;

  ptr = malloc(size);

@end smallexample

@item    The pointer returned has the value @code{NULL} if
     there was no memory left to allocate. This should
     always be checked.

@end itemize

@noindent
The fact that @code{malloc()} always returns a pointer to a character does
not stop it from being used for other types of data too. The cast
operator can force @code{malloc()} to give a pointer to any data type. This
method is used for building data structures in C with "struct" types.

@code{malloc()} has a complementary function which does precisely
the opposite: de-allocates memory. This function is called
@code{free()}. @code{free()} returns an integer code, so it does not
have to be declared as being any special type.

@itemize @bullet
@item  
@code{free()} takes one argument: a pointer to a block of
     memory which has previously been allocated by @code{malloc()}.
@smallexample

  int returncode;

  returncode = free (ptr);

@end smallexample

@item  
The pointer should be declared:
@smallexample

   char *ptr;

@end smallexample

@item   The return code is zero if the release was successful.

@end itemize

An example of how strings can be created using @code{malloc()} and
@code{free()} is given below. First of all, some explanation of Standard
Library Functions is useful to simplify the program.

@node Handling strings, Example 22, Strings from the user, Strings
@section Handling strings
@cindex String handling functions
@cindex strlen

The C Standard Library commonly provides a number of very useful
functions which handle strings. Here is a short list of some common
ones which are immediately relevant (more are listed in the following
chapter). Chances are, a good compiler will support a lot more than
those listed below, but, again, it really depends upon the compiler.

@table @code
@item     strlen()
  This function returns a type int value,
               which gives the length or number of 
               characters in a string, not including the
               @code{NULL} byte end marker. An example is:
@smallexample

  int len;
  char *string;
  len = strlen (string);

@end smallexample

@item strcpy()
  This function copies a string from one place
               to another. Use this function in preference
               to custom routines: it is set up to handle
               any peculiarities in the way data are stored.
               An example is
@smallexample

  char *to,*from;

  to = strcpy (to,from);

@end smallexample
@cindex strcpy

               Where @code{to} is a pointer to the place to which
               the string is to be copied and @code{from} is the
               place where the string is to be copied from.

@item strcmp()
  This function compares two strings and
               returns a value which indicates how they
               compared. An example:
@smallexample

  int value;
  char *s1,*s2;

  value = strcmp(s1,s2);

@end smallexample
               The value returned is 0 if the two strings
               were identical. If the strings were not the
               same, this function indicates the (ASCII)
               alphabetical order of the two. If @code{s1 > s2},
               alphabetically, then the value is @code{> 0}. If 
               @code{s1 < s2} then the value is @code{< 0}. Note that
               numbers come before letters in the ASCII
               code sequence and also that upper case comes
               before lower case.
@cindex strcmp

@item strstr()
Tests whether a substring is present in a larger string
@smallexample

  int n;
  char *s1,*s2;

  if (n = strstr(s1,s2))
     @{
     printf("s2 is a substring of s1, starting at %d",n);
     @}

@end smallexample
@cindex strstr
@cindex Substrings, searching for

@item strncpy()
This function is like @code{strcpy}, but limits the copy to
no more than @code{n} characters.

@item strncmp()
This function is like @code{strcmp}, but limits the comparison to
no more than @code{n} characters.

@end table
@noindent

@node Example 22, String Input/Output, Handling strings, Strings
@section Example Listing

This program aims to get ten strings from the user. The strings
may not contain any spaces or white space characters. It works as
follows:

The user is prompted for a string which he/she types into a
buffer. The length of the string is tested with @code{strlen()} and a block
of memory is allocated for it using @code{malloc()}. (Notice that this block
of memory is one byte longer than the value returned by @code{strlen()},
because @code{strlen()} does not count the end of string marker @samp{\0}.)
@code{malloc()} returns a pointer to the space allocated, which is then
stored in the array called @code{array}. Finally the string is copied from
the buffer to the new storage with the library function @code{strcpy()}. This
process is repeated for each of the 10 strings. Notice that the
program exits through a low level function called @code{QuitSafely()}. The
reason for doing this is to exit from the program neatly, while at the
same time remembering to perform all a programmer's duties, such as
de-allocating the memory which is no longer needed. @code{QuitSafely()} uses
the function @code{exit()} which should be provided as a standard library
function. @code{exit()} allows a program to end at any point.

them. These make it easier to deal with strings, without the need for
special user-routines. There are four of these functions:

@end menu

@node gets(), puts(), String Input/Output, String Input/Output
@subsection @code{gets()}

@cindex gets
This function fetches a string from the standard input file @emph{stdin}
and places it into some buffer which the programmer must provide.
@smallexample

#define SIZE    255

char *sptr, buffer[SIZE];

strptr = gets(buffer);

@end smallexample
If the routine is successful in getting a string, it returns the value
@code{buffer} to the string pointer @code{strptr}. Otherwise it returns
@code{NULL} (==0). The advantage of @code{gets()} over
@code{scanf("%s",...)} is that it will read spaces in strings, whereas
@code{scanf()} usually will not. @code{gets()} quits reading when it
finds a newline character: that is, when the user presses @kbd{RETURN}.

NOTE: there are valid concerns about using this function. Often
it is implemented as a macro with poor bounds checking and can
be exploited to produce memory corruption by system attackers.
In order to write more secure code, use @code{fgets()} instead.

@node puts(), sprintf(), gets(), String Input/Output
@subsection @code{puts()}

@cindex puts
@code{puts()} sends a string to the output file stdout, until it
finds a @code{NULL} end of string marker. The @code{NULL} byte is not
written to stdout, instead a newline character is written.
@smallexample

char *string;
int returncode;

returncode = puts(string);

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{puts()} returns an integer value, whose value is only guaranteed if
there is an error. @code{returncode == EOF} if an end of file was encountered
or there was an error.

@node sprintf(), sscanf(), puts(), String Input/Output
@subsection @code{sprintf()}

This is an interesting function which works in almost the same way as
@code{printf()}, the exception being that it prints to a string! In
other words it treats a string as though it were an output file. This is
useful for creating formatted strings in the memory. On most systems it
works in the following way:
@cindex Printing formatted to strings
@smallexample

int n;
char *sp;

n = sprintf (sp, "control string", parameters, values);

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{n} is an integer which is the number of characters printed.
@code{sp} is a pointer to the destination string or the string which is
to be written to.  Note carefully that this function does not perform
any check on the output string to make sure that it is long enough to
contain the formatted output. If the string is not large enough, then a
crash could be in store! This can also be considered a potential
security problem, since buffer overflows can be used to capture control
of important programs. Note that on system V Unix systems the
@code{sprintf} function returns a pointer to the start of the printed
string, breaking the pattern of the other printf functions. To make such
an implementation compatible with the usual form you would have to
write:
@smallexample

 n = strlen(sprintf(@var{parameters ...}));

@end smallexample

@node sscanf(),  , sprintf(), String Input/Output
@subsection @code{sscanf()}

This function is the complement of @code{sprintf()}. It reads its input
from a string, as though it were an input file.
@smallexample

int n;
char *sp;

n = sscanf (sp,"control string", pointers ...);

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{sp} is a pointer to the string which is to be read from. The string
must be @code{NULL} terminated (it must have a zero-byte end marker
'\0'). @code{sscanf()} returns an integer value which holds the number of
items successfully matched or @code{EOF} if an end of file marker was read or
an error occurred. The conversion specifiers are identical to those
for @code{scanf()}.

@section The argument vector

C was written in order to implement Unix in a portable form. Unix was
designed with a command language which was built up of independent
programs. These could be passed arguments on the command line. For instance:
@smallexample

 ls -l /etc

 cc -o program prog.c

@end smallexample
@noindent
In these examples, the first word is the command itself, while the subsequent
words are options and arguments to the command. We need some way of getting this
information into a C program. Unix solved this problem by passing C programs
an array of these arguments together with their number as parameters to the
function @code{main()}. Since then most other operating systems have adopted
the same model, since it has become a part of the C language.

@smallexample

main (argc,argv)

int argc;
char *argv[];

@{

@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The traditional names for the parameters are the argument count
@code{argc} and the argument vector (array) @code{argv}. The operating system
call which starts the C program breaks up the command line into an array,
where the first element @code{argv[0]} is the name of the command itself
and the last argument @code{argv[argc-1]} is the last argument. For example,
in the case of 
@smallexample

  cc -o program prog.c

@end smallexample
@noindent
would result in the values
@table @code
@item argv[0]
cc
@item argv[1]
-o
@item argv[2]
program
@item argv[3]
prog.c
@end table
The following program prints out the command line arguments:

@smallexample

main (argc,argv)

int argc;
char *argv[];

@{ int i;

printf ("This program is called %s\n",argv[0]);

if (argc > 1)
   @{
   for (i = 1; i < argc; i++)
      @{
      printf("argv[%d] = %s\n",i,argv[i]);
      @}
   @}
else

   printf("Command has no arguments\n");

@section Environment variables

@cindex Environment variables
When we write a C program which reads command line arguments,
they are fed to us by the argument vector. Unix processes
also a set of text variable associations called environment
variables. Each child process inherits the environment of its
parent. The static environment variables are stored in a
special array which is also passed to @code{main()} and
can be read if desired.

@smallexample

main (argc,argv,envp)

int argc;
char *argv[], *envp[];

@{

@}
@end smallexample

@noindent
The array of strings @samp{envp[]} is a list of values of the
@emph{environment variables} of the system, formatted by
@smallexample
NAME=value
@end smallexample

@noindent
This gives C programmers access to the shell's global environment.

@cindex Environment variables in C
@cindex @code{getenv() function}
@vindex @code{getenv()}

In addition to the @samp{envp} vector, it is possible to access the
environment variables through the call @samp{getenv()}. This is used as
follows; suppose we want to access the shell environment variable @samp{$HOME}.
@smallexample
char *string;

string = getenv("HOME");
@end smallexample

@noindent
@samp{string} is now a pointer to static but public data. You should not
use @samp{string} as if it were your own property because it will be
used again by the system. Copy it's contents to another string before
using the data.

@section Character Identification

Some or all of the following functions/macros will be available for
identifying and classifying single characters. The programmer ought to
beware that it would be natural for many of these facilities to exist as
macros rather than functions, so the usual remarks about macro
parameters apply, @xref{Preprocessor}.  An example of their use is
given above.  Assume that `true' has any non-zero, integer value and
that `false' has the integer value zero. @code{ch} stands for some
character, or @code{char} type variable. 
@cindex Character classification

@table @code
@item     isalpha(ch)
         This returns true if @code{ch} is
                         alphabetic and false otherwise. 
                         Alphabetic means @code{a} to @code{z} or 
@code{A} to @code{Z}.

@item      isupper(ch)
         Returns true if the character was
                         upper case. If @code{ch} was not an
                         alphabetic character, this returns
                         false.

@item      islower(ch)              
Returns true if the character was
                         lower case. If @code{ch} was not an
                         alphabetic character, this returns
                         false.

@item      isdigit(ch)              
Returns true if the character was a
                         digit in the range 0 to 9.

@item      isxdigit(ch)
        Returns true if the character was a
                         valid hexadecimal digit: that is, a
                         number from 0 to 9 or a letter a to f
                         or A to F.

@item      isspace(ch)
         Returns true if the character was a
                         white space character, that is: a
                         space, a @kbd{TAB} character or a
                         newline.

@item      ispunct(ch)
         Returns true if @code{ch} is a punctuation
                         character.

@item      isalnum(ch)              
Returns true if a character is
                         alphanumeric: that is, alphabetic
                         or digit.

@item      isprint(ch)
         Returns true if the character is
                         printable: that is, the character
                         is not a control character.

@item      isgraph(ch)
         Returns true if the character is
                         graphic. i.e. if the character
                         is printable (excluding the space)

@item      iscntrl(ch)
         Returns true if the character is
                         a control character. i.e. ASCII
                         values 0 to 31 and 127.

@item      isascii(ch)
         Returns true if the character is
                         a valid ASCII character: that is,
                         it has a code in the range 0 to 127.

@item      iscsym(ch)
          Returns true if the character was
                         a character which could be used in
                         a C identifier.



@item      toupper(ch)
         This converts the character @code{ch} into
                         its upper case counterpart. This
                         does not affect characters which
                         are already upper case, or
                         characters which do not have a
                         particular case, such as digits.

@item      tolower(ch)              
This converts a character into its
                         lower case counterpart. It does
                         not affect characters which are
                         already lower case.

@item     toascii(ch)
          This strips off bit 7 of a
                         character so that it is in the
                         range 0 to 127: that is, a valid
                         ASCII character.

@section String Manipulation

The following functions perform useful functions for string
handling, @xref{Strings}.

@table @code
@item     strcat()
  This function "concatenates" two strings:
               that is, it joins them together into one
               string. The effect of:
@smallexample

 char *new,*this, onto[255];

 new = strcat(onto,this);

@end smallexample
@noindent
               is to join the string @code{this} onto the string
               @code{onto}. @code{new} is a pointer to the complete
               string; it is identical to @code{onto}. Memory is
               assumed to have been allocated for the
               starting strings. The string which is to be
               copied to must be large enough to accept the
               new string, tagged onto the end. If it is not
               then unpredictable effects will result. (In
               some programs the user might get away without
               declaring enough space for the "onto" string,
               but in general the results will be garbage,
               or even a crashed machine.) To join two
               static strings together, the following code
               is required:
@smallexample

 char *s1 = "string one";
 char *s2 = "string two";

 main ()

 @{ char buffer[255];

 strcat(buffer,s1);
 strcat(buffer,s2);
 @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
               buffer would then contain "string onestring
                two".


@item      strlen()
  This function returns a type int value,
               which gives the length or number of 
               characters in a string, not including the
               @code{NULL} byte end marker. An example is:
@smallexample

 int len;
 char *string;
 len = strlen (string);

@end smallexample

@item      strcpy()
  This function copies a string from one place
               to another. Use this function in preference
               to custom routines: it is set up to handle
               any peculiarities in the way data are stored.
               An example is
@smallexample

 char *to,*from;

 to = strcpy (to,from);

@end smallexample
@noindent
               Where @code{to} is a pointer to the place to which
               the string is to be copied and @code{from} is the
               place where the string is to be copied from.

@item      strcmp()
  This function compares two strings and
               returns a value which indicates how they
               compared. An example:
@smallexample

 int value;
 char *s1,*s2;

 value = strcmp(s1,s2);

@end smallexample
               The value returned is 0 if the two strings
               were identical. If the strings were not the
               same, this function indicates the (ASCII)
               alphabetical order of the two. If @code{s1 > s2},
               alphabetically, then the value is @samp{> 0}. If 
               @code{s1 < s2} then the value is @code{< 0}. Note that
               numbers come before letters in the ASCII
               code sequence and also that upper case comes
               before lower case.
@end table

There are also variations on the theme of the functions above which
begin with @samp{strn} instead of @samp{str}. These enable the programmer to
perform the same actions with the first @code{n} characters of a string:

@table @code
@item      strncat()
 This function @emph{concatenates} two strings by
               copying the first @code{n} characters of @code{this} to
               the end of the @code{onto} string.
@smallexample
 char *onto,*new,*this;

 new = strncat(onto,this,n);

@end smallexample

@item      strncpy()
 This function copies the first @code{n} characters
               of a string from one place to another
@smallexample

 char *to,*from;
 int n;

 to = strncpy (to,from,n);

@end smallexample

@item      strncmp()
 This function compares the first @code{n} characters
               of two strings
@smallexample

 int value;
 char *s1,*s2;

 value = strcmp(s1,s2,n);

@end smallexample
@end table
@noindent
The following functions perform conversions between strings and
floating point/integer types, without needing to use @code{sscanf()}. They
take a pre-initialized string and work out the value represented by
that string.
@table @code

@item      atof()
    ASCII to floating point conversion.
@smallexample

 double x;
 char *stringptr;

 x = atof(stringptr);

@end smallexample

@item      atoi()
    ASCII to integer conversion.
@smallexample

 int i;
 char *stringptr;

 i = atoi(stringptr);

@end smallexample

@item      atol()

C has a library of standard mathematical functions which can be
accessed by @code{#includ}ing the appropriate header files (@file{math.h}
etc). It should be noted that all of these functions work with
@code{double} or @code{long float} type variables. All of C's mathematical
capabilities are written for long variable types. Here is a list of
the functions which can be expected in the standard library file. The
variables used are all to be declared @code{long}
@smallexample

int i;                   /* long int */
double x,y,result;       /* long float */

@end smallexample
@noindent
The functions themselves must be declared long float or double (which
might be done automatically in the mathematics library file, or in a
separate file) and any constants must be written in floating point
form: for instance, write @samp{7.0} instead of just @samp{7}.

@cindex Math errors
Mathematical functions can be delicate animals. There exist
mathematical functions which simply cannot produce sensible answers in
all possible cases. Mathematical functions are not "user friendly"!
One example of an unfriendly function is the inverse sine function
@code{asin(x)} which only works for values of @code{x} in the range +1.0 to
-1.0. The reason for this is a mathematical one: namely that the sine
function (of which @code{asin()} is the opposite) only has values in this
range. The statement
@smallexample

 y = asin (25.3);

@end smallexample
@noindent
is nonsense and it cannot possibly produce a value for @code{y}, because none
exists. Similarly, there is no simple number which is the square root
of a negative value, so an expression such as:
@smallexample

 x = sqrt(-2.0);

@end smallexample
@noindent
would also be nonsense. This doesn't stop the programmer from writing
these statements though and it doesn't stop a faulty program from
straying out of bounds. What happens then when an erroneous statement
is executed? Some sort of error condition would certainly have to
result.

In many languages, errors, like the ones above, are terminal:
they cause a program to stop without any option to recover the
damage. In C, as the reader might have come to expect, this is not the
case. It is possible (in principle) to recover from any error, whilst
still maintaining firm control of a program.

Errors like the ones above are called domain errors (the set of
values which a function can accept is called the domain of the
function). There are other errors which can occur too. For example,
division by zero is illegal, because dividing by zero is "mathematical
nonsense" -- it can be done, but the answer can be all the numbers
which exist at the same time! Obviously a program cannot work with any
idea as vague as this. Finally, in addition to these "pathological"
cases, mathematical operations can fail just because the numbers they
deal with get too large for the computer to handle, or too small, as
the case may be.

@table @emph
@item Domain error
        Illegal value put into function
@item     Division by zero
    Dividing by zero is nonsense.

@item     Loss of accuracy
   No meaningful answer could be
                         calculated
@end table

Errors are investigated by calling a function called
@code{matherr()}. The mathematical functions, listed above, call this
function automatically when an error is detected. The function
responds by returning a value which gives information about the
error. The exact details will depend upon a given compiler. For
instance a hypothetical example: if the error could be recovered from,
@code{matherr()} returns 0, otherwise it returns -1. @code{matherr()} uses a
"struct" type variable called an "exception" to diagnose faults in
mathematical functions, @xref{Structures and Unions}. This can be
examined by programs which trap their errors dutifully. Information
about this structure must be found in a given compiler manual.

Although it is not possible to generalize, the following remarks
about the behaviour of mathematical functions may help to avoid any
surprises about their behaviour in error conditions.

@itemize @bullet

@item  
 A function which fails to produce a sensible answer,
     for any of the reasons above, might simply return zero
     or it might return the maximum value of the computer.
     Be careful to check this. (Division by zero and
     underflow probably return zero, whereas overflow
     returns the maximum value which the computer can
     handle.) 

@item 
Some functions return the value @samp{NaN}. Not
a form of Indian unleavened bread, this stands for `Not a Number',
i.e. no sensible result could be calculated.

@item
  Some method of signalling errors must clearly be used.
     This is the exception structure (a special kind of C
     variable) which gives information about the last error
     which occurred. Find out what it is and trap errors!

@item
   Obviously, wherever possible, the programmer should try
     to stop errors from occurring in the first place.

@node Example 27, Questions 21, Maths Errors, Special Library Functions and Macros
@section Example

Here is an example for the mathematically minded. The program
below performs numerical integration by the simplest possible method
of adding up the area under small strips of a graph of the function
@code{f(y) = 2*y}. The integral is found between the limits 0 and 5 and the
exact answer is 25. (See diagram.) The particular compiler used for
this program returns the largest number which can be represented by
the computer when numbers overflow, although, in this simple case, it
is impossible for the numbers to overflow.

@cindex Operators, hidden
Many operators in C are more versatile than they appear to be, at
first glance. Take, for example, the following operators
@smallexample

   =     ++     --   +=  -=   etc.

@end smallexample
@noindent
the assignment, increment and decrement operators ... These innocent
looking operators can be used in some surprising ways which make C
source code very neat and compact.

The first thing to notice is that @code{++} and @code{--} are
unary operators: that is, they are applied to a single variable and
they affect that variable alone. They therefore produce one unique
value each time they are used. The assignment operator, on the other
hand, has the unusual position of being both unary, in the sense that
it works out only one expression, and also binary or dyadic because it
sits between two separate objects: an "lvalue" on the left hand side
and an expression on the right hand side. Both kinds of operator have
one thing in common however: both form statements which have values in
their own right. What does this mean? It means that certain kinds of
statement, in C, do not have to be thought of as being complete and
sealed off from the rest of a program. To paraphrase a famous author:
"In C, no statement is an island". A statement can be taken as a whole
(as a "black box") and can be treated as a single value, which can
be assigned and compared to things! The value of a statement is the
result of the operation which was carried out in the statement.

Increment/decrement operator statements, taken as a whole, have a
value which is one greater / or one less than the value of the
variable which they act upon. So:
@smallexample

  c = 5;

  c++;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The second of these statement @samp{c++;} has the value 6, and similarly:
@smallexample

  c = 5;

  c--;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The second of these statements @samp{c--;} has the value 4.
Entire assignment statements have values too. A statement such
as:
@smallexample

  c = 5;

@end smallexample
@noindent
has the value which is the value of the assignment. So the example
above has the value 5. This has some important implications.

@node Extended and Hidden =, Example 28, Hidden Operators, Hidden Operators
@section Extended and Hidden @code{=}

The idea that an assignment statement has a value, can be used to
make C programs neat and tidy for one simple reason: it means that a
whole assignment statement can be used in place of a value. For
instance, the value @samp{c = 0;} could be assigned to a variable b:
@smallexample

   b = (c = 0);

@end smallexample
@noindent
or simply:
@smallexample

   b = c = 0;

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
These equivalent statements set @code{b}
and @code{c} to the value zero, provided b and c are of the same type!
It is equivalent to the more usual:
@smallexample

   b = 0;
   c = 0;

@end smallexample
Indeed, any number of these assignments can be strung together:
@smallexample

  a = (b = (c = (d = (e = 5))))

@end smallexample
@noindent
or simply:
@smallexample

  a = b = c = d = e = 5;

@end smallexample
@noindent
This very neat syntax compresses five lines of code into one single
line!
There are other uses for the valued assignment statement, of
course: it can be used anywhere where a value can be used. For
instance:
@itemize @bullet
@item
In other assignments (as above)
@item
As a parameter for functions
@item
Inside a comparison (== > < etc.)
@item
As an index for arrays ...
@end itemize
@noindent
The uses are manifold. Consider how an assignment statement might be
used as a parameter to a function. The function below gets a character
from the input stream @code{stdin} and passes it to a function called
@code{ProcessCharacter()}:
@smallexample

ProcessCharacter (ch = getchar());

@end smallexample
@noindent
This is a perfectly valid statement in C, because the hidden
assignment statement passes on the value which it assigns. The actual
order of events is that the assignment is carried out first and then
the function is called. It would not make sense the other way around,
because, then there would be no value to pass on as a
parameter. So, in fact, this is a more compact way of writing:
@smallexample

ch = getchar();
ProcessCharacter (ch);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The two methods are entirely equivalent. If there is any doubt,
examine a little more of this imaginary character processing program:
@smallexample

ProcessCharacter(ch = getchar());

if (ch == '*')
   @{
   printf ("Starry, Starry Night ...");
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The purpose in adding the second statement is to impress the fact that
@code{ch} has been assigned quite legitimately and it is still defined in the
next statement and the one after ... until it is re-assigned by a new
assignment statement. The fact that the assignment was hidden inside
another statement does not make it any less valid. All the same
remarks apply about the specialized assignment operators @code{+=},
@code{*=}, @code{/=}
etc.

@section Hidden @code{++} and @code{--}

The increment and decrement operators also form statements which
have intrinsic values and, like assignment expressions, they can be
hidden away in inconspicuous places. These two operators are slightly
more complicated than assignments because they exist in two forms: as
a postfix and as a prefix:
@smallexample

     @var{Postfix}             @var{Prefix}

     var++               ++var

     var--               --var

@end smallexample
@noindent
and these two forms have subtly different meanings. Look at the
following example:
@smallexample

   int i = 3;

   PrintNumber (i++);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The increment operator is hidden in the parameter list of the function
@code{PrintNumber()}. This example is not as clear cut as the assignment
statement examples however, because the variable @code{i} has, both a value
before the @code{++} operator acts upon it, and a different value
afterwards. The question is then: which value is passed to the
function? Is @code{i} incremented before or after the function is called?
The answer is that this is where the two forms of the operator come
into play.

@b{
If the operator is used as a prefix, the operation is
performed @emph{before} the function call. If the operator is
used as a postfix, the operation is performed after the
function call.
}

In the example above, then, the value 3 is passed to the function and
when the function returns, the value of @code{i} is incremented to 4. The
alternative is to write:
@smallexample

   int i = 3;

   PrintNumber (++i);

@end smallexample
@noindent
in which case the value 4 is passed to the function @code{PrintNumber()}.
The same remarks apply to the decrement operator.

increment and decrement operators are used a lot. Hiding operators
inside array subscripts or hiding assignments inside loops can often
make light work of tasks such as initialization of arrays. Consider
the following example of a one dimensional array of integers.
@smallexample

#define SIZE   20

int i, array[SIZE];

for (i = 0; i < SIZE; array[i++] = 0)
   @{
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This is a neat way of initializing an array to zero. Notice that the
postfixed form of the increment operator is used. This prevents the
element @code{array[0]} from assigning zero to memory which is out of the
bounds of the array. 

Strings too can benefit from hidden operators. If the standard
library function @code{strlen()} (which finds the length of a string) were
not available, then it would be a simple matter to write the function
@smallexample

strlen (string)   /* count the characters in a string */

char *string;

@{ char *ptr;
  int count = 0;

for (ptr = string; *(ptr++) != '\0'; count++)
   @{
   @}

return (count);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This function increments
count while the end of string marker @samp{\0} is not found.

@cindex Style
Hiding operators away inside other statements can certainly make
programs look very elegant and compact, but, as with all neat tricks,
it can make programs harder to understand. Never forget that
programming is communication to other programmers and be kind to the
potential reader of a program. (It could be you in years or months to come!)
Statements such as:
@smallexample

if ((i = (int)ch++) <= --comparison)
   @{
   @}

are not recommendable programming style and they are no more efficient
than the more longwinded:
@smallexample

ch++;
i = (int)ch;

if (i <= comparison)
   @{
   @}

comparison--;

@end smallexample
@noindent
There is always a happy medium in which to settle on a readable
version of the code. The statement above might perhaps be written as:

i = (int) ch++;

@section Special Constant Expressions

Constant expressions are often used without any thought, until a
programmer needs to know how to do something special with them. It is
worth making a brief remark about some special ways of writing integer
constants, for the latter half of this book.

Up to now the distinction between long and short integer types
has largely been ignored. Constant values can be declared explicitly
as long values, in fact, by placing the letter @code{L} after the constant.
@smallexample

long int variable = 23L;

variable = 236526598L;

@end smallexample
@noindent
@cindex Constant expressions
Advanced programmers, writing systems software, often find it
convenient to work with hexadecimal or octal numbers since these
number bases have a special relationship to binary. A constant in one
of these types is declared by placing either @samp{0} (zero) or @samp{0x} in
front of the appropriate value. If @var{ddd} is a value, then:
@smallexample

Octal number          0@var{ddd}
Hexadecimal number    0x@var{ddd}

@end smallexample
@noindent
For example:
@smallexample

oct_value = 077;         /* 77 octal */

hex_value = 0xFFEF;      /* FFEF hexadecimal */

@end smallexample
@noindent
This kind of notation has already been applied to strings and single
character constants with the backslash notation, instead of the
leading zero character:
@smallexample

ch = '\@var{ddd}';

ch = '\x@var{dd}';

@end smallexample
@noindent
The values of character constants, like these, cannot be any
greater than 255.

@node FILE, enum, Special Constant Expressions, More on Data Types
@section @code{FILE}

@cindex enum type
@cindex Enumerated data
In all previous chapters, the files @code{stdin}, @code{stdout} and 
@code{stderr}
alone have been used in programs. These special files are always
handled implicitly by functions like @code{printf()} and @code{scanf()}: the
programmer never gets to know that they are, in fact, files. Programs
do not have to use these functions however: standard input/output
files can be treated explicitly by general file handling functions
just as well. Files are distinguished by filenames and by file
pointers. File pointers are variables which pass the location of files
to file handling functions; being variables, they have to be declared
as being some data type. That type is called @code{FILE} and file pointers
have to be declared "pointer to @code{FILE}". For example:
@smallexample

    FILE *fp;

    FILE *fp = stdin;

    FILE *fopen();

@end smallexample
@noindent
@cindex FILE
File handling functions which return file pointers must also be declared
as pointers to files. Notice that, in contrast to all the other reserved
words @code{FILE} is written in upper case: the reason for this is that
@code{FILE} is not a simple data type such as @code{char} or @code{int},
but a @emph{structure} which is only defined by the header file
@file{stdio.h} and so, strictly speaking, it is not a reserved word
itself.  We shall return to look more closely at files soon.

@node enum, Example 31, FILE, More on Data Types
@section @code{enum}

Abstract data are usually the realm of exclusively high level
languages such as Pascal. @code{enum} is a way of incorporating limited
"high level" data facilities into C.

@code{enum} is short for enumerated data. The user defines a type of
data which is made up of a fixed set of words, instead of numbers or
characters. These words are given substitute integer numbers by the
compiler which are used to identify and compare @code{enum} type data. For
example:
@smallexample

enum countries

   @{
   England,
   Scotland,
   Wales,
   Eire,
   Norge,
   Sverige,
   Danmark,
   Deutschland
   @};

main ()

@{ enum countries variable;

variable = England;
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Why go to all this trouble? The point about enumerated data is
that they allow the programmer to forget about any numbers which the
computer might need in order to deal with a list of words, like the
ones above, and simply concentrate on the logic of using
them. Enumerated data are called abstract because the low level
number form of the words is removed from the users attention. In fact,
enumerated data are made up of integer constants, which the compiler
generates itself. For this reason, they have a natural partner in
programs: the switch statement. Here is an example, which uses the
countries above to make a kind of airport "help computer" in age of
electronic passports!

@noindent
@code{enum} makes words into constant integer values for a
programmer. Data which are declared @code{enum} are not the kind of data
which it makes sense to do arithmetic with (even integer arithmetic),
so in most cases it should not be necessary to know or even care about
what numbers the compiler gives to the words in the list. However,
some compilers allow the programmer to force particular values on
words. The compiler then tries to give the values successive integer
numbers unless the programmer states otherwise. For instance:
@smallexample

enum planets
   @{
   Mercury,
   Venus,
   Earth = 12,
   Mars,
   Jupiter,
   Saturn,
   Uranus,
   Neptune,
   Pluto
   @};

@end smallexample
This would probably yield values @code{Mercury = 0}, 
@code{Venus = 1}, @code{Earth = 12},
@code{Mars = 13}, @code{Jupiter = 14} and so on.
If the user tries to force a value which the compiler has already
used then the compiler will complain.

@code{enum} types can be local or global.

@node void, volatile, Suggested uses for enum, More on Data Types
@section @code{void}

@cindex void
@code{void} is a peculiar data type which has some debatable uses.  The
void data type was introduced in order to make C syntactically
consistent. The main idea of @code{void} is to be able to declare
functions which have no return value. The word `void' is intended in the
meaning `empty' rather than `invalid'.  If you recall, the default is
for C functions to return a value of type @code{int}. The value returned
by a function did not @emph{have} to be specified and could always be
discarded, so this was not a problem in practice. It did make compiler
checks more difficult however: how do you warn someone about
inconsistent return values if it is legal to ignore return values?

The ANSI solution was to introduce a new data type which was called
@code{void} for functions with no value. The word @code{void} is perhaps an
unfortunate choice, since it has several implicit meanings none of
which really express what is intended. The words `novalue' or `notype'
would have been better choices.
A variable or function can be declared @code{void} in the following ways.
@smallexample

   void function();
   void variable;
   void *ptr;

   (void) returnvalue();

@end smallexample
The following are true of @code{void}:
@itemize @bullet

@item
   A variable which is declared @code{void} is useless: it cannot
     be used in an expression and it cannot be assigned to
     a value. The data type was introduced with functions in
mind but the grammar of C allows us to define variables of this
type also, even though there is no point.

@item  A function which is declared @code{void} has no return value
     and returns simply with:
@smallexample

   return;

@end smallexample

@item 
 A function call can be cast @code{(void)} in order to explicitly
     discard a return value (though this is done by the
     compiler anyway). For instance, @code{scanf()} returns the
     number of items it matches in the control string, but
     this is usually discarded. 
@smallexample

        scanf ("%c",&ch);

@end smallexample
@noindent
 or
@smallexample

  (void) scanf("%c",&ch);

@end smallexample
Few programmers would do this since it merely clutters up
programs with irrelevant verbiage.

@item 
A @code{void} pointer can point to any kind of object. This
     means that any pointer can be assigned to a @code{void}
     pointer, regardless of its type. This is also a highly
questionable feature of the ANSI draft. It replaces the meaning
of @code{void} from `no type or value' to `no particular type'.
It allows assignments between incompatible pointer types without
a cast operator. This is also rather dubious.

@end itemize

@node volatile, const, void, More on Data Types
@section @code{volatile}

@cindex volatile
@code{volatile} is a type which has been proposed in the ANSI
standard. The idea behind this type is to allow memory mapped
input/output to be held in C variables. Variables which are declared
volatile will be able to have their values altered in ways which a
program does not explicitly define: that is, by external influences
such as clocks, external ports, hardware, interrupts etc.  

The @code{volatile} data type has found another use since the arrival of
multiprocessor, multithreaded operating systems. Independent processes
which share common memory could each change a variable independently.
In other words, in a multithreaded environment the value of a variable
set by one process in shared memory might be altered by another process
without its knowledge. The keyword @code{volatile} serves as a
warning to the compiler that any optimizing code it produces should
not rely on caching the value of the variable, it should always
reread its value.


@node const, struct again, volatile, More on Data Types
@section @code{const}

@cindex const, constants
The reserved word @code{const} is used to declare data which can only be
assigned once, either because they are in ROM (for example) or because
they are data whose values must not be corrupted. Types declared const
must be assigned when they are first initialized and they exist as
stored values only at compile time:
@smallexample

const double pi = 3.14;
const int one = 1;

@end smallexample
@noindent
Since a constant array only exists at compile time, it can be
initialized by the compiler.
@smallexample

const int array[] = 
   @{
   1,
   2,
   3,
   4
   @};

@end smallexample 

@noindent 
@code{array[0]} then has the value 1,
@code{array[1]} has the value 2 and so on. Any attempt to assign
values to const types will result in compilation errors.

It is worth comparing the @code{const} declaration to enumerated data,
since they are connected in a very simple way. The following two sets
of statements are the same:
@smallexample

  enum numbers
     @{
     zero,
     one,
     two,
     three,
     four
     @};

@end smallexample
@noindent
and
@smallexample

const zero = 0;
const one = 1;
const two = 2;
const three = 3;
const four = 4;

@end smallexample
@noindent
Constant types and enumerated data are therefore just different
aspects of the same thing. Enumerated data provide a convenient way of
classifying constants, however, while the compiler keeps track of the
values and types. With @code{const} you have to keep track of constant values
personally.

  typedef type newtypename;

@end smallexample
@noindent
So, for example, we could define a type called @code{byte}, which
was exactly one byte in size by redefining the word @code{char}:
@smallexample

  typedef unsigned char byte;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The compiler type checking facilities then treat byte as a new type
which can be used to declare variables:
@smallexample

  byte variable, function();

@end smallexample
@noindent
The typedef statement may be written inside functions or in the global
white space of a program.

@smallexample

/**************************************************/

typedef int newname1;

@{
typedef char newname2;

@end smallexample
@noindent
This program will compile and run (though it will not do very much).

It is not very often that you want to rename existing
types in the way shown above. The most important use for typedef is in
conjunction with structures and unions. Structures and unions can, by
their very definition, be all kinds of shape and size and their names
can become long and tedious to declare. typedef makes dealing with
these simple because it means that the user can define a structure or
union with a simple typename.

@cindex Bit operations
Down in the depths of your computer, below even the operating
system are bits of memory. These days we are used to working at such a
high level that it is easy to forget them.  Bits (or binary digits) are
the lowest level software objects in a computer: there is nothing more
primitive. For precisely this reason, it is rare for high
level languages to even acknowledge the existence of bits, let alone
manipulate them. Manipulating bit patterns is usually the preserve of
assembly language programmers. C, however, is quite different from most
other high level languages in that it allows a programmer full access to
bits and even provides high level operators for manipulating them.

Since this book is an introductory text, we shall treat bit operations
only superficially. Many of the facilities which are available for bit
operations need not concern the majority of programs at all. This
section concerns the main uses of bit operations for high level programs
and it assumes a certain amount of knowledge about programming at the
low level. You may wish to consult a book on
assembly language programming to learn about low level memory
operations in more detail.

@section Bit Patterns

All computer data, of any type, are bit patterns. The only
difference between a string and a floating point variable is the way
in which we choose to interpret the patterns of bits in a
computer's memory. For the most part, it is quite unnecessary to think
of computer data as bit patterns; systems programmers, on the other
hand, frequently find that they need to handle bits directly in order
to make efficient use of memory when using flags. A flag is a
message which is either one thing or the other: in system terms, the
flag is said to be `on' or `off' or alternatively @emph{set} or
@emph{cleared}. The usual place to find flags is in a status register of a
CPU (central processor unit) or in a pseudo-register (this is a status
register for an imaginary processor, which is held in memory). A
status register is a group of bits (a byte perhaps) in which each bit
signifies something special. In an ordinary byte of data, bits are
grouped together and are interpreted to have a collective meaning; in
a status register they are thought of as being
independent. Programmers are interested to know about the contents of
bits in these registers, perhaps to find out what happened in a
program after some special operation is carried out. Other uses for
bit patterns are listed below here:

@itemize @bullet

@item    Messages sent between devices in a complex operating
     environment use bits for efficiency.

@item    Serially transmitted data.

@item    Handling bit-planes in screen memory. (Raster
     ports and devices)

@item   Performing fast arithmetic in simple cases.
@end itemize

Programmers who are interested in performing bit operations often
work in hexadecimal because every hexadecimal digit conveniently
handles four bits in one go (16 is 2 to the power 4).

@node Flags Registers and Messages, Bit Operators and Assignments, Bit Patterns, Machine Level Operations
@section Flags, Registers and Messages

A @emph{register} is a place inside a computer processor chip, where
data are worked upon in some way.
A @emph{status register} is a register which is used to return
information to a programmer about the operations which took place in
other registers. Status registers contain flags which give yes or no
answers to questions concerning the other registers.
In advanced programming, there may be call for "pseudo registers"
in addition to "real" ones. A pseudo register is merely a register
which is created by the programmer in computer memory (it does not
exist inside a processor).

Messages are just like pseudo status registers: they are
collections of flags which signal special information between
different devices and/or different programs in a computer
system. Messages do not necessarily have fixed locations: they may be
passed as parameters. Messages are a very compact way of passing
information to low level functions in a program.
Flags, registers, pseudo-registers and messages are all treated
as bit patterns. A program which makes use of them must therefore be
able to assign these objects to C variables for use. A bit pattern
would normally be declared as a character or some kind of integer type
in C, perhaps with the aid of a typedef statement.
@smallexample

     typedef char byte;

     typedef int bitpattern;

     bitpattern variable;
     byte message;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The flags or bits in a register/message ... have the values 1 or 0,
depending upon whether they are on or off (set or cleared). A
program can test for this by using combinations of the operators which
C provides.

@node Bit Operators and Assignments, Bit operators, Flags Registers and Messages, Machine Level Operations
@section Bit Operators and Assignments

C provides the following operators for handling bit patterns:

@table @code

@item     <<
   Bit shift left (a specified number of bit positions)
@item     >>
   Bit shift right(a specified number of bit positions)

@item     |
    Bitwise Inclusive OR
@item     ^
    Bitwise Exclusive OR
@item     &
    Bitwise AND
@item     ~
    Bitwise one's complement

@item     &=
   AND assign          (variable = variable & value)
@item     |=
   Exclusive OR assign (variable = variable | value)
@item     ^=
   Inclusive OR assign (variable = variable ^ value)
@item     >>=
  Shift right assign  (variable = variable >> value)
@item     <<=
  Shift left assign   (variable = variable << value)

@end table

@noindent
The meaning and the syntax of these operators is given below.

@node Bit operators, Shift Operations, Bit Operators and Assignments, Machine Level Operations
@section The Meaning of Bit Operators

Bitwise operations are not to be confused with logical operations
(@code{&&}, @code{||}, ...) A bit pattern is made up of 0s and 1s and
bitwise operators operate individually upon each bit in the
operand. Every 0 or 1 undergoes the operations individually.
Bitwise operators (AND, OR) can be used in place of logical
operators (@code{&&},@code{||}), but they are less efficient, because logical
operators are designed to reduce the number of comparisons made, in an
expression, to the optimum: as soon as the truth or falsity of an
expression is known, a logical comparison operator quits. A bitwise
operator would continue operating to the last before the final result
were known.

Below is a brief summary of the operations which are performed by
the above operators on the bits of their operands.

@node Shift Operations, Truth Tables and Masking, Bit operators, Machine Level Operations
@section Shift Operations

Imagine a bit pattern as being represented by the following group
of boxes. Every box represents a bit; the numbers inside represent
their values. The values written over the top are the common integer
values which the whole group of bits would have, if they were
interpreted collectively as an integer.
@smallexample

     128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1

      -------------------------------
     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |       = 1
      -------------------------------

@end smallexample
@noindent
Shift operators move whole bit patterns left or right by shunting them
between boxes. The syntax of this operation is:
@smallexample

     value << number of positions

     value >> number of positions

@end smallexample
@noindent
So for example, using the boxed value (1) above:
@smallexample

     1 << 1

@end smallexample
@noindent
would have the value 2, because the bit pattern would have been moved
one place to the left:
@smallexample

     128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1

      -------------------------------
     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |       = 2
      -------------------------------

@end smallexample
Similarly:
@smallexample

     1 << 4

@end smallexample
@noindent
has the value 16 because the original bit pattern is moved by four places:
@smallexample

     128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1

      -------------------------------
     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |       = 16
      -------------------------------

@end smallexample
@noindent
And: 
@smallexample

   6 << 2 == 12

     128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1

      -------------------------------
     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |       = 6
      -------------------------------

@end smallexample
@noindent
Shift left 2 places:
@smallexample

     128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1

      -------------------------------
     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |       = 12
      -------------------------------

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice that every shift left multiplies by 2 and that every shift
right would divide by two, integerwise. If a bit reaches the edge of
the group of boxes then it falls out and is lost forever. So:
@smallexample

               1 >> 1 == 0
               2 >> 1 == 1
               2 >> 2 == 0
               n >> n == 0

@end smallexample
@noindent
A common use of shifting is to scan through the bits of a
bitpattern one by one in a loop: this is done by using @emph{masks}.

@node Truth Tables and Masking, Example 33, Shift Operations, Machine Level Operations
@section Truth Tables and Masking

The operations AND, OR (inclusive OR) and XOR/EOR (exclusive OR)
perform comparisons or "masking" operations between two bits. They are
binary or dyadic operators. Another operation called COMPLEMENT is a
unary operator. The operations performed by these bitwise operators
are best summarized by @emph{truth tables}. Truth tables indicate what the
results of all possible operations are between two single bits. The
same operation is then carried out for all the bits in the variables
which are operated upon.

@node Masks,  , XOR, Truth Tables and Masking
@subsection Masks

Bit patterns and logic operators are often used to make @emph{masks}. A
mask can be thought of as a thing which fits over a bit pattern and
modifies the result in order perhaps to single out particular bits,
usually to cover up part of a bit pattern. This is particularly
pertinent for handling flags, where a programmer wishes to know if one
particular flag is set or not set and does not care about the values
of the others. This is done by deliberately inventing a value which
only allows the particular flag of interest to have a non-zero value
and then ANDing that value with the flag register. For example: in
symbolic language:
@smallexample

MASK = 00000001

VALUE1 = 10011011
VALUE2 = 10011100

MASK & VALUE1 == 00000001
MASK & VALUE2 == 00000000

@end smallexample

The zeros in the mask @emph{mask off} the first seven bits and leave only
the last one to reveal its true value. Alternatively, masks can be
built up by specifying several flags:

@smallexample

FLAG1 = 00000001
FLAG2 = 00000010
FLAG3 = 00000100

MESSAGE = FLAG1 | FLAG2 | FLAG3

MESSAGE == 00000111

@end smallexample
@noindent
It should be emphasized that these expressions are only written in
symbolic language: it is not possible to use binary values in C. The
programmer must convert to hexadecimal, octal or denary first. (See
the appendices for conversion tables).

@node Example 33, Output 33, Truth Tables and Masking, Machine Level Operations
@section Example

A simple example helps to show how logical masks and shift
operations can be combined. The first program gets a denary number
from the user and converts it into binary. The second program gets a
value from the user in binary and converts it into hexadecimal.

@chapter Files and Devices

@cindex Files
Files are places for reading data from or writing data to. This includes
disk files and it includes devices such as the printer or the monitor of
a computer. C treats all information which enters or leaves a program as
though it were a stream of bytes: a file. The most commonly used file
streams are @code{stdin} (the keyboard) and @code{stdout} (the screen),
but more sophisticated programs need to be able to read or write to
files which are found on a disk or to the printer etc.

An operating system allows a program to see files in the outside world
by providing a number of channels or `portals' (`inlets' and `outlets')
to work through. In order to examine the contents of a file or to write
information to a file, a program has to @emph{open} one of these
portals. The reason for this slightly indirect method of working is that
channels/portals hide operating system dependent details of filing from
the programmer. Think of it as a protocol.  A program which writes
information does no more than pass that information to one of these
portals and the operating system's filing subsystem does the rest. A
program which reads data simply reads values from its file portal and
does not have to worry about how they got there. This is extremely
simple to work in practice.  To use a file then, a program has to go
through the following routine:

@itemize @bullet
@item
 Open a file for reading or writing. (Reserve a portal
     and locate the file on disk or whatever.)

@item
 Read or write to the file using file handling functions
     provided by the standard library.

@item
Close the file to free the operating system "portal"
     for use by another program or file.
@end itemize

A program opens a file by calling a standard library function and
is returned a file pointer, by the operating system, which allows a
program to address that particular file and to distinguish it from all
others.

@section Files Generally

C provides two levels of file handling; these can be called high level
and low level. High level files are all treated as text files. In fact,
the data which go into the files are exactly what would be seen on the
screen, character by character, except that they are stored in a file
instead. This is true whether a file is meant to store characters,
integers, floating point types. Any file, which is written to by high
level file handling functions, ends up as a text file which could be
edited by a text editor.

High level text files are also read back as character files, in
the same way that input is acquired from the keyboard. This all means
that high level file functions are identical in concept to
keyboard/screen input/output.

The alternative to these high level functions, is obviously low
level functions. These are more efficient, in principle, at filing
data as they can store data in large lumps, in raw memory format,
without converting to text files first. Low level input/output
functions have the disadvantage that they are less `programmer
friendly' than the high level ones, but they are likely to work
faster.

@node File Positions, High Level File Handling Functions, Files Generally, Files and Devices
@section File Positions

When data are read from a file, the operating system keeps track
of the current position of a program within that file so that it only
needs to make a standard library call to `read the next part of the
file' and the operating system obliges by reading some more and
advancing its position within the file, until it reaches the end. Each
single character which is read causes the position in a file to be
advanced by one.

Although the operating system does a great deal of hand holding
regarding file positions, a program can control the way in which that
position changes with functions such as @code{ungetc()} if need be. In most
cases it is not necessary and it should be avoided, since complex
movements within a file can cause complex movements of a disk drive
mechanism which in turn can lead to wear on disks and the occurrence
of errors.

@node High Level File Handling Functions, Opening files, File Positions, Files and Devices
@section High Level File Handling Functions

Most of the high level input/output functions which deal with
files are easily recognizable in that they start with the letter
`f'. Some of these functions will appear strikingly familiar. For
instance:

@smallexample

fprintf()
fscanf()
fgets()
fputs()

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
These are all generalized file handling versions of the
standard input/output library. They work with generalized files, as
opposed to the specific files stdin and stdout which @code{printf()}
and @code{scanf()} use. The file versions differ only in that they
need an extra piece of information: the file pointer to a particular
portal. This is passed as an extra parameter to the functions. they
process data in an identical way to their standard I/O counterparts.
Other filing functions will not look so familiar. For example:

@smallexample

fopen()
fclose()
getc()
ungetc();
putc()
fgetc()
fputc()
feof()

@end smallexample
@noindent
Before any work can be done with high level files, these
functions need to be explained in some detail.

@node Opening files, Closing a file, High Level File Handling Functions, Files and Devices
@section Opening files

A file is opened by a call to the library function @code{fopen()}: this
is available automatically when the library file <stdio.h> is
included. There are two stages to opening a file: firstly a file
portal must be found so that a program can access information from a
file at all. Secondly the file must be physically located on a disk or
as a device or whatever. The @code{fopen()} function performs both of these
services and, if, in fact, the file it attempts to open does not
exist, that file is created anew. The syntax of the @code{fopen()} function
is:
@smallexample

     FILE *returnpointer;

     returnpointer = fopen("filename","mode");

@end smallexample
@noindent
or
@smallexample

     FILE returnpointer;
     char *fname, *mode;

     returnpointer = fopen(fname,mode);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The filename is a string which provides the name of the file to be
opened. Filenames are system dependent so the details of this must be
sought from the local operating system manual. The operation mode is
also a string, chosen from one of the following:

@table @samp
@item r
  Open file for reading
@item w
  Open file for writing
@item a
 Open file for appending
@item rw
 Open file for reading and writing (some systems)
@end table

This mode string specifies the way in which the file will be
used. Finally, @code{returnpointer} is a pointer to a @code{FILE} structure which is
the whole object of calling this function. If the file (which was
named) opened successfully when @code{fopen()} was called, returnpointer is a
pointer to the file portal. If the file could not be opened, this
pointer is set to the value @code{NULL}. This should be tested for, because
it would not make sense to attempt to write to a file which could not
be opened or created, for whatever reason.

A read only file is opened, for example, with some
program code such as:
@cindex Opening a file
@cindex File, opening

@smallexample

FILE *fp;

if ((fp = fopen ("filename","r")) == NULL)

   @{
   printf ("File could not be opened\n");
   error_handler();
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
A question which springs to mind is: what happens if the user has
to type in the name of a file while the program is running? The
solution to this problem is quite simple. Recall the function
@code{filename()} which was written in chapter 20.

@smallexample

char *filename()                   /* return  filename */

@{ static char *filenm = "........................";

do
   @{
   printf ("Enter filename :");
   scanf ("%24s",filenm);
   skipgarb();
   @}
while (strlen(filenm) == 0);
return (filenm);
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This function makes file opening simple. The programmer would now
write something like:
@smallexample

FILE *fp;
char *filename();

if ((fp = fopen (filename(),"r")) == NULL)

   @{
   printf ("File could not be opened\n");
   error_handler();
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
and then the user of the program would automatically be prompted for a
filename.  Once a file has been opened, it can be read from or written
to using the other library functions (such as @samp{fprintf()} and
@code{fscanf()}) and then finally the file has to be closed again.

@node Closing a file, fprintf, Opening files, Files and Devices
@section Closing a file

A file is closed by calling the function
@code{fclose()}. @code{fclose()} has the syntax:
@smallexample

int returncode;
FILE *fp;

returncode = fclose (fp);

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{fp} is a pointer to the file which is to be closed and returncode is an
integer value which is 0 if the file was closed successfully. @code{fclose()}
prompts the file manager to finish off its dealings with the named
file and to close the portal which the operating system reserved for
it. When closing a file, a program needs to do something like the
following:
@smallexample

if (fclose(fp) != 0)

   @{
   printf ("File did not exist.\n");
   error_handler();
   @}

@end smallexample

@node fprintf, fscanf, Closing a file, Files and Devices
@section @code{fprintf()}

This is the highest level function which writes to files. Its
name is meant to signify "file-print-formatted" and it is almost
identical to its stdout counterpart @code{printf()}. The form of the
@code{fprintf()} statement is as follows:
@smallexample

fprintf (fp,"string",variables);

@end smallexample
@noindent
where @code{fp} is a file pointer, string is a control string which is to be
formatted and the variables are those which are to be substituted into
the blank fields of the format string. For example, assume that there
is an open file, pointed to by @code{fp}:
@smallexample

int i = 12;
float x = 2.356;
char ch = 's';

fprintf (fp, "%d %f %c", i, x, ch);

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
The conversion specifiers are identical to
those for @code{printf()}. In fact @code{fprintf()} is related to
@code{printf()} in a very simple way: the following two statements are
identical.
@smallexample

printf ("Hello world %d", 1);

fprintf (stdout,"Hello world %d", 1);

@end smallexample

@node fscanf, skipfilegarb?, fprintf, Files and Devices
@section @code{fscanf()}

The analogue of @code{scanf()} is @code{fscanf()} and, as with 
@code{fprintf()}, this
function differs from its standard I/O counterpart only in one extra
parameter: a file pointer. The form of an @code{fscanf()} statement is:
@smallexample

FILE *fp;
int n;

n = fscanf (fp,"string",pointers);

@end smallexample
@noindent
where @code{n} is the number of items matched in the control string
and @code{fp} is a pointer to the file which is to be read from. For
example, assuming that @code{fp} is a pointer to an open file:
@smallexample

int i = 10;
float x = -2.356;
char ch = 'x';

fscanf (fp, "%d %f %c", &i, &x, &ch);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The remarks which were made about @code{scanf()} also apply to this function:
@code{fscanf()} is a `dangerous' function in that it can easily get out of
step with the input data unless the input is properly formatted.

@node skipfilegarb?, Single Character I/O, fscanf, Files and Devices
@section skipfilegarb() ?

Do programs need a function such as @code{skipgarb()} to deal with
instances of badly formatted input data?
A programmer can assume a bit more about files which are read
into a program from disk file than it can assume about the user's
typed input. A disk file will presumably have been produced by the
same program which generated it, or will be in a format which the
program expects. Is a function like @code{skipgarb()} necessary then? The
answer is: probably not. This does not mean to say that a program does
not need to check for "bad files", or files which do not contain the
data they are alleged to contain. On the other hand, a programmer is
at liberty to assume that any file which does not contain correctly
formatted data is just nonsense: he/she does not have to try to make
sense of it with a function like @code{skipgarb()}, the program could simply
return an error message like "BAD FILE" or whatever and recover in a
sensible way. It would probably not make sense to use a function like
@code{skipgarb()} for files.
For comparison alone, @code{skipfilegarb()} is written below.

@smallexample

skipfilegarb(fp)

FILE *fp;

@{
while (getc(fp) != '\n')
   @{
   @}
@}

@end smallexample

@node Single Character I/O, getc and fgetc, skipfilegarb?, Files and Devices
@section Single Character I/O


There are commonly four functions/macros which perform single
character input/output to or from files. They are analogous to the
functions/macros

@smallexample

  getchar() 
  putchar()

@end smallexample
@noindent
for the standard I/O files and they are called:
@smallexample

     getc()
     ungetc();
     putc()
     fgetc()
     fputc()

@end smallexample

@node getc and fgetc, ungetc, Single Character I/O, Files and Devices
@section @code{getc()} and @code{fgetc()}

The difference between @code{getc()} and @code{fgetc()} will depend
upon a particular system. It might be that getc() is implemented as a
macro, whereas @code{fgetc()} is implemented as a function or vice
versa. One of these alternatives may not be present at all in a
library. Check the manual, to be sure! Both @code{getc()} and
@code{fgetc()} fetch a single character from a file:

@smallexample

FILE *fp;
char ch;

/* open file */

ch = getc (fp);
ch = fgetc (fp);

@end smallexample
@noindent
These functions return a character from the specified file if they
operated successfully, otherwise they return @code{EOF} to indicate the end
of a file or some other error. Apart from this, these functions/macros
are quite unremarkable.

@node ungetc, putc and fputc, getc and fgetc, Files and Devices
@section @code{ungetc()}

@code{ungetc()} is a function which `un-gets' a character from a
file. That is, it reverses the effect of the last get
operation. This is not like writing to a file, but it is like stepping
back one position within the file. The purpose of this function is to
leave the input in the correct place for other functions in a program
when other functions go too far in a file.  An example of this would
be a program which looks for a word in a text file and processes that
word in some way.
@smallexample

while (getc(fp) != ' ')
   @{
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
The program would skip over spaces until it found a character and then
it would know that this was the start of a word. However, having used
@code{getc()} to read the first character of that word, the position in the
file would be the second character in the word! This means that, if
another function wanted to read that word from the beginning, the
position in the file would not be correct, because the first character
would already have been read. The solution is to use @code{ungetc()} to move
the file position back a character:
@smallexample

int returncode;

returncode = ungetc(fp);

@end smallexample
The returncode is EOF if the operation was unsuccessful.

@node putc and fputc, fgets and fputs, ungetc, Files and Devices
@section @code{putc()} and @code{fputc()}

These two functions write a single character to the output file, pointed
to by @code{fp}. As with @code{getc()}, one of these may be a macro. The
form of these statements is:
@smallexample

FILE *fp;
char ch;
int returncode;

returncode = fputc (ch,fp);
returncode =  putc (ch,fp);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The returncode is the ascii code of the character sent, if the
operation was successful, otherwise it is EOF.

@node fgets and fputs, feof, putc and fputc, Files and Devices
@section @code{fgets()} and @code{fputs()}

Just as @code{gets()} and @code{puts()} fetched and sent strings to
standard input/output files stdin and stdout, so @code{fgets()} and
@code{fputs()} send strings to generalized files.  The form of an
@code{fgets()} statement is as follows:
@smallexample

char *strbuff,*returnval;
int n;
FILE *fp;

returnval = fgets (strbuff,n,fp);

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{strbuff} is a pointer to an input buffer for the string; fp is a
pointer to an open file. returnval is a pointer to a string: if there
was an error in @code{fgets()} this pointer is set to the value @code{NULL},
otherwise it is set to the value of "strbuff". No more than (n-1)
characters are read by @code{fgets()} so the programmer has to be sure to set
n equal to the size of the string buffer. (One byte is reserved for
the NULL terminator.)
The form of an @code{fputs()} statement is as follows:
@smallexample

char *str;
int returnval;
FILE *fp;

returnval = fputs (str,fp);

@end smallexample
@noindent
Where @code{str} is the @code{NULL} terminated string which is to be
sent to the file pointed to by @code{fp}. @code{returnval} is set to
@code{EOF} if there was an error in writing to the file.

@node feof, Printer Output, fgets and fputs, Files and Devices
@section feof()

@cindex End of file
@cindex File, detecting end of
This function returns a true or false result. It tests whether or
not the end of a file has been reached and if it has it returns `true'
(which has any value except zero); otherwise the function returns
`false' (which has the value zero). The form of a statement using this
function is:
@smallexample

FILE *fp;
int outcome;

outcome = feof(fp);

@end smallexample
@noindent
Most often @code{feof()} will be used inside loops or conditional
statements. For example: consider a loop which reads characters from
an open file, pointed to by @code{fp}. A call to @code{feof()} is required in order
to check for the end of the file.
@smallexample

while (!feof(fp))
   @{
   ch = getc(fp);
   @}

@end smallexample
Translated into pidgin English, this code reads: `while NOT end of
file, @code{ch} equals get character from file'. In better(?) English the
loop continues to fetch characters as long as the end of the file has
not been reached. Notice the logical NOT operator @samp{!} which stands
before @code{feof()}.

@node Printer Output, Example 36, feof, Files and Devices
@section Printer Output

Any serious application program will have to be in full control
of the output of a program. For instance, it may need to redirect
output to the printer so that data can be made into hard copies. To do
this, one of three things must be undertaken:

@table @bullet
@item   
@code{stdout} must be redirected so that it sends data to
     the printer device.

@item    
A new "standard file" must be used (not all C compilers
     use this method.)

@item   
A new file must be opened in order to write to the printer device
@end table

The first method is not generally satisfactory for application
programs, because the standard files @code{stdin} and @code{stdout}
can only easily be redirected from the operating system command line
interpreter (when a program is run by typing its name). Examples of
this are:
@smallexample

              type file > PRN

@end smallexample
@noindent
which send a text file to the printer device. The second method is
reserved for only a few implementations of C in which another `standard
file' is opened by the local operating system and is available for
sending data to the printer stream. This file might be called "stdprn"
or "standard printer file" and data could be written to the printer by
switching writing to the file like this:
@smallexample

fprintf (stdprn,"string %d ...", integer);

@end smallexample
The final method of writing to the printer is to open a file to
the printer, personally. To do this, a program has to give the
"filename" of the printer device. This could be something like "PRT:"
or "PRN" or "LPRT" or whatever. The filename (actually called a pseudo
device name) is used to open a file in precisely the same way as any
other file is opened: by using a call to @code{fopen()}. 
@code{fopen()} then returns
a pointer to file (which is effectively "stdprn") and this is used to
write data to a computer's printer driver. The program code to do this
should look something like the following:
@smallexample

FILE *stdprn;

if ((stdprn = fopen("PRT:","w")) == NULL)
   @{
   printf ("Printer busy or disconnected\n");
   error_handler;
   @}

@end smallexample

@node Example 36, Output 36, Printer Output, Files and Devices
@section Example

Here is an example program which reads a source file (for a
program, written in C, Pascal or whatever ...) and lists it, along with
its line numbers. This kind of program is useful for debugging
programs. The program provides the user with the option of sending the
output to the printer. The printer device is assumed to have the
filename "PRT:". Details of how to convert the program for other
systems is given at the end.

The example program could be altered to work with a standard

@smallexample

int status;

@node File Errors, Other Facilities for High Level Files, Converting example, Files and Devices
@section Filing Errors

@cindex Errors, files
The standard library provides an error function/macro which
returns a true/false result according to whether or not the last
filing function call returned an error condition. This is called
@code{ferror()}. To check for an error in an open file, pointed to by
@code{fp}:
@smallexample

FILE *fp;

if (ferror(fp))
   @{
   error_handler();
   @}

@end smallexample
This function/macro does not shed any light upon the cause of
errors, only whether errors have occurred at all. A detailed diagnosis
of what went wrong is only generally possible by means of a deeper
level call to the disk operating system (DOS).


@node Other Facilities for High Level Files, fread() and fwrite(), File Errors, Files and Devices
@section Other Facilities for High Level Files

Files which have been opened by @code{fopen()} can also be handled with
the following additional functions:
@smallexample

fread()
fwrite()

ftell()
fseek()
rewind()
fflush()

@end smallexample

These functions provide facilities to read and write whole blocks
of characters in one operation as well as further facilities to locate
and alter the current focus of attention within a file. They offer,
essentially, low level filing operations for files which have been
opened for high level use!

@node fread() and fwrite(), ftell and fseek, Other Facilities for High Level Files, Files and Devices
@section @code{fread()} and @code{fwrite()}

These functions read and write whole blocks of characters at a
time. The form of @code{fread()} is as follows:
@smallexample

FILE *fp;
int  noread,n,size;
char *ptr;

noread = fread (ptr,size,n,fp);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The parameters in parentheses provide information about where the data will
be stored once they have been read from a file. @code{fp} is a pointer
to an open file; @code{ptr} is a pointer to the start of a block of
memory which is to store the data when it is read; size is the size of a
block of data in characters; @code{n} is the number of blocks of data to
be read. Finally @code{noread} is a return value which indicates the
number of blocks which was actually read during the operation. It is
important to check that the number of blocks expected is the same as the
number received because something could have gone wrong with the reading
process. (The disk might be corrupted or the file might have been
altered in some way.)  @code{fwrite()} has an identical call structure
to @code{fread()}:
@smallexample

FILE *fp;
int  nowritten,n,size;
char *ptr;

nowritten = fwrite (ptr,size,n,fp);

@end smallexample
@noindent
This time the parameters in parentheses provide information about where the
data, to be written to a file, will be found. @code{fp} is a pointer to
an open file; @code{ptr} is a pointer to the start of a block of memory
at which the data are stored; size is the size of a "block" of data in
characters; @code{n} is the number of blocks of data to be read;
@code{nowritten} is a return value which indicates the actual number of
blocks which was written. Again, this should be checked.

A caution about these functions: each of these block transfer
routines makes an important assumption about the way in which data are
stored in the computer system. It is assumed that the data are stored
@emph{contiguously} in the memory, that is, side by side, in sequential
memory locations. In some systems this can be difficult to arrange (in
multi-tasking systems in particular) and almost impossible to
guarantee. Memory which is allocated in C programs by the function
@code{malloc()} does not guarantee to find contiguous portions of memory on
successive calls. This should be noted carefully when developing
programs which use these calls.

@node ftell and fseek, rewind, fread() and fwrite(), Files and Devices
@section File Positions: ftell() and fseek()

@code{ftell()} tells a program its position within a file, opened by
@code{fopen()}.
@code{fseek()} seeks a specified place within a file, opened by
@code{fopen()}.
Normally high level read/write functions perform as much
management over positions inside files as the programmer wants, but in
the event of their being insufficient, these two routines can be
used. The form of the function calls is:
@smallexample

long int pos;
FILE *fp;

pos = ftell(fp);

@end smallexample
@code{fp} is an open file, which is in some state of being read or written
to. @code{pos} is a long integer value which describes the position in terms
of the number of characters from the beginning of the file.
Aligning a file portal with a particular place in a file is
more sophisticated than simply taking note of the current
position. The call to @code{fseek()} looks like this:
@smallexample

long int pos;
int mode,returncode;
FILE *fp;

returncode = fseek (fp,pos,mode);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The parameters have the following meanings. @code{fp} is a pointer to a file
opened by @code{fopen()}. pos is some way of describing the position required
within a file. mode is an integer which specifies the way in which pos
is to be interpreted. Finally, @code{returncode} is an integer whose value is
0 if the operation was successful and -1 if there was an error.

@table @code
@item     0
    @code{pos} is an offset measured relative to the beginning
     of the file.
@item     1 
   @code{pos} is an offset measured relative to the current
     position.
@item     2 
   @code{pos} is an offset measured relative to the end of the
     file.

@end table
Some examples help to show how this works in practice:
@smallexample

long int pos = 50;
int mode = 0,returncode;
FILE *fp;

if (fseek (fp,pos,mode) != 0) /* find 50th character */
   @{
   printf("Error!\n");
   @}

fseek(fp,0L,0);                /* find beginning of file */
fseek(fp,0L,2);                /* find the end of a file */

if (fseek (fp,10L,1) != 0)     /* move 10 characters forward */
   @{
   printf("Error!\n");
   @}

@end smallexample
The @code{L}'s indicate @code{long} constants.

@node rewind, fflush, ftell and fseek, Files and Devices
@section @code{rewind()}

@code{rewind()} is a macro, based upon @code{fseek()}, which resets a file
position to the beginning of the file. e.g.
@smallexample

FILE *fp;

rewind(fp);

fseek(fp,0L,0);                /* = rewind() */

@end smallexample

@node fflush, Low Level Filing Operations, rewind, Files and Devices
@section @code{fflush()}

This is a macro/function which can be used on files which have
been opened for writing or appending. It flushes the output buffer
which means that it forces the characters in the output buffer to be
written to the file. If used on files which are open for reading, it
causes the input buffer to be emptied (assuming that this is allowed
at all). Example:
@smallexample

FILE *fp;

fflush(fp);

@end smallexample

@node Low Level Filing Operations, File Handles, fflush, Files and Devices
@section Low Level Filing Operations

Normally a programmer can get away with using the high level
input/output functions, but there may be times when C's predilection
for handling all high level input/output as text files, becomes a
nuisance. A program can then use a set of low level I/O functions
which are provided by the standard library. These are:
@smallexample

open()
close()
creat()
read()
write()
rename()
unlink()/remove()
lseek()

@end smallexample
@noindent
These low level routines work on the operating system's end of the
file portals. They should be regarded as being advanced features of
the language because they are dangerous routines for bug ridden
programs. The data which they deal with is untranslated: that is, no
conversion from characters to floating point or integers or any type
at all take place. Data are treated as a raw stream of bytes. Low
level functions should not be used on any file at the same time as
high level routines, since high level file handling functions often
make calls to the low level functions.

Working at the low level, programs can create, delete and rename
files but they are restricted to the reading and writing of
untranslated data: there are no functions such as @code{fprintf()} or
@code{fscanf()} which make type conversions. As well as the functions listed
above a local operating system will doubtless provide special function
calls which enable a programmer to make the most of the facilities
offered by the particular operating environment. These will be
documented, either in a compiler manual, or in an operating system
manual, depending upon the system concerned. (They might concern
special graphics facilities or windowing systems or provide ways of
writing special system dependent data to disk files, such as date/time
stamps etc.)

@node File Handles, open, Low Level Filing Operations, Files and Devices
@section File descriptors

@cindex File handles
@cindex File descriptors
At the low level, files are not handled using file pointers, but
with integers known as file handles or file descriptors. A file handle
is essentially the number of a particular file portal in an
array. In other words, for all the different terminology, they
describe the same thing. For example:
@smallexample

int fd;

@end smallexample
@noindent
would declare a file @emph{handle} or @emph{descriptor} or @emph{portal}
or whatever it is to be called.

@node open, close, File Handles, Files and Devices
@section @code{open()}

@code{open()} is the low level file open function. The form of this 
function call is:
@smallexample

int fd, mode;
char *filename;

fd = open (filename,@var{mode});

@end smallexample
@noindent
where filename is a string which holds the name of the file concerned,
mode is a value which specifies what the file is to be opened for and
@code{fd} is either a number used to distinguish the file from
others, or -1 if an error occurred.

A program can give more information to this function than it can
to @code{fopen()} in order to define exactly what @code{open()} will do. 
The integer
@var{mode} is a message or a pseudo register which passes the necessary
information to @code{open()}, by using the following flags:
@smallexample

O_RDONLY       Read access only
O_WRONLY       Write access only
O_RDWR         Read/Write access

@end smallexample
@noindent
and on some compilers:
@smallexample

O_CREAT        Create the file if it does not exist
O_TRUNC        Truncate the file if it does exist
O_APPEND       Find the end of the file before each write
O_EXCL         Exclude. Force create to fail if the file
               exists.
@end smallexample
@noindent
The macro definitions of these flags will be included in a
library file: find out which one and @code{#include} it in the program.
The normal procedure is to open a file using one of the first
three modes. For example:
@smallexample

#define FAILED -1

main()

@{ char *filename();
  int fd;

fd = open(filename(), O_RDONLY);

if (fd == FAILED)
   @{
   printf ("File not found\n");
   error_handler (failed);
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
This opens up a read-only file for low level handling, with error
checking.  Some systems allow a more flexible way of opening files. The
four appended modes are values which can be bitwise ORed with one of the
first three in order to get more mileage out of @code{open()}. The
bitwise OR operator is the vertical bar "|". For example, to emulate the
@code{fopen()} function a program could opt to create a file if it did
not already exist:
@smallexample

 fd = open (filename(), O_RDONLY | O_CREAT);

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{open()} sets the file position to zero if the file is opened
successfully.

@node close, creat, open, Files and Devices
@section @code{close()}

@code{close()} releases a file portal for use by other files and brings
a file completely up to date with regard to any changes that have been
made to it. Like all other filing functions, it returns the value 0 if
it performs successfully and the value -1 if it fails. e.g.
@smallexample

#define FAILED -1

if (close(fd) == FAILED)
   @{
   printf ("ERROR!");
   @}

@end smallexample

@node creat, read, close, Files and Devices
@section @code{creat()}

This function creates a new file and prepares it for access using
the low level file handling functions. If a file which already exists
is created, its contents are discarded. The form of this function call
is:
@smallexample

int fd, pmode;
char *filename;

fd = creat(filename,pmode);

@end smallexample
@code{filename} must be a valid filename; pmode is a flag which contains
access-privilege mode bits (system specific information about allowed
access) and @code{fd} is a returned file handle. In the absence of
any information about @code{pmode}, this parameter can be set to zero.
Note that, the action of creating a file opens it too. Thus after a call
to @code{creat}, you should close the file descriptor.

@node read, write, creat, Files and Devices
@section read()

This function gets a block of information from a file. The data
are loaded directly into memory, as a sequence of bytes. The user must
provide a place for them (either by making an array or by using
@code{malloc()} to reserve space). @code{read()} keeps track of file positions
automatically, so it actually reads the next block of bytes from the
current file position. The following example reads @code{n} bytes from a
file:
@smallexample

int returnvalue, fd, n;
char *buffer;

if ((buffer = malloc(size)) == NULL)
   @{
   puts ("Out of memory\n");
   error_handler ();
   @}

returnvalue = read (fd,buffer,n);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The return value should be checked. Its values are defined as follows:

@table @code

@item     0 
 End of file
@item -1
   Error occurred

@item @var{n}
                        the number of bytes actually
                        read. (If all went well this
                         should be equal to @var{n}.)
@end table

@node write, lseek, read, Files and Devices
@section @code{write()}

This function is the opposite of @code{read()}. It writes a block
of @var{n} bytes from a contiguous portion of memory to a file which
was opened by @code{open()}. The form of this function is:
@smallexample

int returnvalue, fd, n;
char *buffer;

returnvalue = write (fd,buffer,n);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The return value should, again, be checked for errors:
@table @code
@item -1
Error

@item @var{n}
Number of bytes written
@end table

@node lseek, unlink remove, write, Files and Devices
@section @code{lseek()}

Low level file handling functions have their equivalent of @code{fseek()}
for finding a specific position within a file. This is almost
identical to @code{fseek()} except that it uses the file handle rather than a
file pointer as a parameter and has a different return value. The
constants should be declared @code{long int}, or simply @code{long}.
@smallexample

#define FAILED  -1L

long int pos,offset,fd;
int mode,returncode;

if ((pos = fseek (fd,offset,mode)) == FAILED)
   @{
   printf("Error!\n");
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{pos} gives the new file position if successful, and -1 (long) if an
attempt was made to read past the end of the file.
The values which @code{mode} can take are:

@table @code
@item  0
 Offset measured relative to the beginning
     of the file.
@item 1    
Offset measured relative to the current
     position.
@item 2    
Offset measured relative to the end of the
     file.
@end table

@node unlink remove, Example 37, lseek, Files and Devices
@section @code{unlink()} and @code{remove()}

These functions delete a file from disk storage. Once deleted,
files are usually irretrievable. They return -1 if the action failed.

@smallexample

#define FAILED -1

int returnvalue;
char *filename;

if (unlink (filename) == FAILED)
   @{
   printf ("Can't delete %s\n",filename);
   @}

if (remove (filename) == FAILED)
   @{
   printf ("Can't delete %s\n",filename);
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{filename} is a string containing the name of the file concerned. This
function can fail if a file concerned is protected or if it is not
found or if it is a device. (It is impossible to delete the printer!)

rename()

This function renames a file. The programmer specifies two
filenames: the old filename and a new file name. As usual, it returns
the value -1 if the action fails. An example illustrates the form of
the @code{rename()} call:
@smallexample

#define FAILED -1

char *old,*new;

if (rename(old,new) == FAILED)
   @{
   printf ("Can't rename %s as %s\n",old,new);
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{rename()} can fail because a file is protected or because it is in use,
or because one of the filenames given was not valid.

@node Example 37, Questions 25, unlink remove, Files and Devices
@section Example

This example strings together some low level filing actions so as
to illustrate their use in a real program. The idea is to present a
kind of file or "project" menu for creating, deleting, renaming
files. A rather feeble text editor allows the user to enter 255
characters of text which can be saved.

Tidy programs are a blessing to programmers. Tidy data are just as
important.  As programs become increasingly complex, their data also
grow in complexity and single, independent variables or arrays are no
longer enough. What one then needs is a @code{data structure}. This is
where a new type of variable comes in: it is called a @code{struct}
type, or in other languages, a record. @code{struct} types or
@emph{structures} are usually lumped together with another type of
variable called a @code{union}. In fact their purposes are quite different.

@node Black Box Data, struct, Structures and Unions, Structures and Unions
@section Organization: Black Box Data

What is the relationship between a program and its data?  Think of a
program as an operator which operates on the memory of the
computer. Local data are operated upon inside sealed function capsules,
where they are protected from the reach of certain parts of a
program. Global data are wide open to alteration by any part of a
program. If a program were visualized schematically what would it look
like? A traditional flow diagram? No: a computer program only looks like
a flow diagram at the machine code level and that is too primitive for C
programmers. One way of visualizing a program is illustrated by the
diagram over the page.

@image{img/26.1,12cm}

This shows a program as a kind of society of sealed function
capsules which work together like a beehive of activity upon a
honeycomb of program data. This imaginative idea is not a bad picture
of a computer program, but it is not complete either. A program has to
manipulate data: it has to look at them, move them around and copy
them from place to place. All of these things would be very difficult
if data were scattered about liberally, with no particular
structure. For this reason C has the facility, within it, to make
sealed capsules -- not of program code -- but of program data, so that
all of these actions become very simple by grouping variables together in
convenient packages for handling. These capsules are called
structures.

@node struct, Declarations again, Black Box Data, Structures and Unions
@section struct

A @emph{structure} is a package of one or usually more variables
which are grouped under a single name. Structures are not like arrays:
a structure can hold any mixture of different types of data: it can
even hold arrays of different types. A structure can be as simple or
as complex as the programmer desires.

The word @code{struct} is a reserved word in C and it represents a new
data type, called an aggregate type. It is not any single type: the
purpose of structures is to offer a tool for making whatever shape or
form of variable package that a programmer wishes. Any particular
structure type is given a name, called a structure-name and the
variables (called members) within a structure type are also given
names.  Finally, every variable which is declared to be a particular
structure type has a name of its own too. This plethora of names is
not really as complicated as it sounds.

@node Declarations again, Scope again, struct, Structures and Unions
@section Declarations

A structure is declared by making a blank template for a variable
package. This is most easily seen with the help of an example. The
following statement is actually a declaration, so it belongs with
other declarations, either at the head of a program or at the start of
a block.
@smallexample

struct PersonalData

   @{
   char name[namesize];
   char address[addresssize];
   int YearOfBirth;
   int MonthOfBirth;
   int DayOfBirth;
   @};

@end smallexample
@noindent
The purpose of this statement is to create a model or template to
define what a variable of type @code{struct PersonalData} will look like. It
says: define a type of variable which collectively holds a string called
@code{name}, a string called @code{address} and three integers called
@code{YearOfBirth}, @code{MonthOfBirth} and @code{DayOfBirth}. Any
variable which is declared to be of type @code{struct PersonalData} will
be collectively made up of parts like these. The list of variable
components which make up the structure are called the members of the
structure: the names of the members are not the names of variables, but
are a way of naming the parts which make up a structure variable. (Note:
a variable which has been declared to be of type @code{struct} @var{something} is
usually called just a structure rather than a structure
variable. The distinction is maintained here in places where confusion
might arise.) The names of members are held separate from the names of
other identifiers in C, so it is quite possible to have variable names
and struct member names which are the same. Older compilers did not
support this luxury.

At this stage, no storage has been given over to a variable, nor
has any variable been declared: only a type has been defined. Having
defined this type of structure, however, the programmer can declare
variables to be of this type. For example:
@smallexample

struct PersonalData x;

@end smallexample
@noindent
declares a variable called @code{x} to be of type @code{struct PersonalData}. @code{x}
is certainly not a very good name for any variable which holds a
person's personal data, but it contrasts well with all the other names
which are abound and so it serves its purpose for now.

Before moving on to consider how structures can be used, it is
worth pausing to show the different ways in which structures can be
declared. The method shown above is probably the most common one,
however there are two equivalent methods of doing the same thing.
A variable can be declared immediately after the template definition.
@smallexample

struct PersonalData

   @{
   char name[namesize];
   char address[addresssize];
   int YearOfBirth;
   int MonthOfBirth;
   int DayOfBirth;
   @}
   x;             /* variable identifier follows type */

@end smallexample
@noindent
Alternatively, @code{typedef} can be used to cut down a bit on typing in
the long term. This type definition is made once at the head of the
program and then subsequent declarations are made by using the new name:
@smallexample

typedef struct 

   @{
   char name[namesize];
   char address[addresssize];
   int YearOfBirth;
   int MonthOfBirth;
   int DayOfBirth;
   @}

PersonalData;

@end smallexample
@noindent
then declare:
@smallexample

PersonalData x;

@end smallexample
@noindent
Any one of these methods will do.

@node Scope again, Using Structures, Declarations again, Structures and Unions
@section Scope

Both structure types and structure variables obey the rules of
scope: that is to say, a structure type declaration can be local or
global, depending upon where the declaration is made. Similarly if a
structure type variable is declared locally it is only valid inside
the block parentheses in which it was defined.
@smallexample

main ()

@{ struct ONE

    @{
    int a;
    float b;
    @};

  struct ONE x;

@}

function ()

@{ struct ONE x;        /* This line is illegal, since ONE */
                        /* is a local type definition      */
                        /* Defined only in main()          */
@}

@end smallexample

@node Using Structures, Arrays of Structures, Scope again, Structures and Unions
@section Using Structures

How does a program use the variables which are locked inside structures?
The whole point about structures is that they can be used to
group data into sensible packages which can then be treated as single
objects. Early C compilers, some of which still exist today, placed
very severe restrictions upon what a program could do with
structures. Essentially, the members of a structure could be assigned
values and pointers to individual structures could be found. Although
this sounds highly restrictive, it did account for the most frequent
uses of structures. Modern compilers allow more flexible use of
structures: programs can assign one structure variable to another
structure variable (provided the structures match in type); structure
variables can be passed, whole, as parameters to functions and
functions can return structure values. This makes structures extremely
powerful data objects to have in a program.
A structure is assigned to another structure by the following statements.
@smallexample

struct Personal x,y;

x = y;

@end smallexample
@noindent
The whole bundle of members is copied in one statement!
Structures are passed as parameters in the usual way:
@smallexample

function (x,y);

@end smallexample
@noindent
The function then has to be declared:
@smallexample

function (x,y)

struct PersonalData x,y;

@{
@}

@end smallexample
Finally, a function which returns a structure variable such as:
@smallexample

@{ struct PersonalData x,function();

x = function();
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
would be declared in the following way:
@smallexample

struct PersonalData function ()

@{
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice that the return type of such a function must also be declared
in the function which calls it, in the usual way. The reader will
begin to see that structure names account for a good deal of typing!
The typedef statement is a very good way of reducing this burden.

The members of a structure are accessed with the @samp{.} dot
character. This is a structure @emph{member operator}. Consider the
structure variable @code{x}, which has the type @code{struct PersonalData}. The
members of @code{x} could be assigned by the following program:
@smallexample

main ()

@{ struct PersonalData x;

FillArray ("Some name", x.name);
FillArray ("Some address", x.address);
x.YearOfBirth = 1987;
x.MonthOfBirth = 2;
x.DayOfBirth = 19;
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
where @code{FillArray()} is a hypothetical function which copies the string
in the first parameter to the array in the second parameter. The dot
between the variable and the names which follow implies that the
statements in this brief program are talking about the members in the
structure variable @code{x}, rather than the whole collective bundle. Members
of actual structure variables are always accessed with this dot
operator. The general form of a member reference is:
@smallexample

     @var{structure variable}.@var{member name}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This applies to any type of structure variable, including those
accessed by pointers. Whenever a program needs to access the members
of a structure, this dot operator can be used. C provides a special
member operator for pointers, however, because they are used so often
in connection with structures. This new operator is described below.

@node Arrays of Structures, Example 38, Using Structures, Structures and Unions
@section Arrays of Structures

Just as arrays of any basic type of variable are allowed, so are
arrays of a given type of structure. Although a structure contains
many different types, the compiler never gets to know this information
because it is hidden away inside a sealed structure capsule, so it can
believe that all the elements in the array have the same type, even
though that type is itself made up of lots of different types. An
array would be declared in the usual way:
@smallexample

int i, j;

struct PersonalData x,array[size];

@end smallexample
@noindent
The members of the arrays would then be accessed by statements like
the following examples:
@smallexample

array[i] = x;

array[i] = array[j];

array[i].YearOfBirth = 1987;

i = array[2].MonthOfBirth;

@end smallexample

@node Example 38, Structures of Structures, Arrays of Structures, Structures and Unions
@section Example

This listing uses a structure type which is slightly different to
PersonalData in that string pointers are used instead of arrays. This
allows more convenient handling of real-life strings.

@node Structures of Structures, Pointers to Structures, Example 38, Structures and Unions
@section Structures of Structures

Structures are said to nest. This means that structure
templates can contain other structures as members. Consider two
structure types:
@smallexample

struct first_structure
   @{
   int value;
   float number;
   @};

@end smallexample
@noindent
and
@smallexample

struct second_structure
   @{
   int tag;
   struct first_structure fs;
   @}
x;

@end smallexample
@noindent
These two structures are of different types, yet the first of the two
is included in the second! An instance of the second structure would
be initialized by the following assignments. The structure variable
name is @code{x}:
@smallexample

x.tag = 10;
x.fs.value = 20;
x.fs.number = 30.0;

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice the way in which the member operator @samp{.} can be used over and
over again. Notice also that no parentheses are necessary, because the
reference which is calculated by this operator is worked out from left
to right. This nesting can, in principle, go on many times, though
some compilers might place restrictions upon this nesting
level. Statements such as:
@smallexample

  variable.tag1.tag2.tag3.tag4 = something;

@end smallexample
@noindent
are probably okay (though they do not reflect good
programming). Structures should nest safely a few times.

A word of caution is in order here. There is a problem with the
above scheme that has not yet been addressed. It is this: what happens
if a structure contains an instance of itself? For example:
@smallexample

struct Regression
   @{
   int i;
   struct Regression tag;
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
There is simply no way that this kind of statement can make sense,
unless the compiler's target computer has an infinite supply of
memory! References to variables of this type would go on for ever and
an infinite amount of memory would be needed for every variable. For
this one reason, it is forbidden for a structure to contain an
instance of itself. What is not forbidden, however, is for a structure
to contain an instance of a pointer to its own type (because a pointer
is not the same type as a structure: it is merely a variable which
holds the address of a structure). Pointers to structures are quite
invaluable, in fact, for building data structures such as linked lists
and trees. These extremely valuable devices are described below.

@node Pointers to Structures, Example 39, Structures of Structures, Structures and Unions
@section Pointers to Structures

A pointer to a structure type variable is declared by a statement
like:
@smallexample

struct Name *ptr;

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{ptr} is then, formally, a pointer to a structure of type @code{Name}
only. @code{ptr} can be assigned to any other pointer of similar type and it
can be used to access the members of a structure. It is in the second
of these actions that a new structure operator is revealed.
According to the rules which have been described so far, a structure
member could be accessed by pointers with the following statements:
@smallexample

struct PersonalData *ptr;

(*ptr).YearOfBirth = 20;

@end smallexample
@noindent
This says let the member @code{YearOfBirth} of the structure pointed to by
ptr, have the value 20. Notice that @code{*ptr}, by itself, means the
contents of the address which is held in ptr and notice that the
parentheses around this statement avoid any confusion about the
precedence of these operators.
There is a better way to write the above statement, however,
using a new operator: @samp{->}. This is an arrow made out of a minus sign
and a greater than symbol and it is used simply as follows:
@smallexample

struct PersonalData *ptr;

ptr->YearOfBirth = 20;

@end smallexample
@noindent
This statement is identical in every way to the first version, but since
this kind of access is required so frequently, when dealing with
structures, C provides this special operator to make the operation
clearer.  In the statements above, it is assumed that @code{ptr} has
been assigned to the address of some pre-assigned structure: for
example, by means of a statement such as:
@smallexample

  ptr = &x;

@end smallexample
@noindent
where @code{x} is a pre-assigned structure.

@section Creating Memory for Dynamical struct Types

@cindex Memory allocation, dynamical
@cindex malloc
Probably the single most frequent use of struct type variables is
in the building of dynamical data structures. Dynamical
data are data which are created explicitly by a
program using a scheme of memory allocation and pointers. Normal
program data, which are reserved space by the compiler, are, in fact,
static data structures because they do not change during the course of
a program: an integer is always an integer and an array is always an
array: their sizes cannot change while the program is running.
A dynamical structure is built using the memory allocation
function:
@smallexample

  malloc()

@end smallexample
@noindent
and pointers. The idea is to create the memory space for a new
structure as and when it is needed and to use a pointer to access the
members of that structure, using the @samp{->} operator.
@code{malloc()} was described in connection with strings:
it allocates a fixed number of bytes of memory and returns a pointer
to that data. For instance, to allocate ten bytes, one would write
something like this:
@smallexample

char *malloc(), *ptr;

ptr = malloc(10);

@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{ptr} is then a pointer to the start of that block of 10 bytes. When a
program wants to create the space for a structure, it has a template
for that structure, which was used to define it, but it does not
generally know, in advance, how many bytes long a structure is. In
fact, it is seldom possible to know this information, since a
structure may occupy more memory than the sum of its parts. How then
does a program know how much space to allocate? The C compiler comes
to the rescue here, by providing a compile time operator called
@smallexample

   sizeof ()

@end smallexample
@noindent
which calculates the size of an object while a program is
compiling. For example:
@table @code
@item     sizeof(int)
Works out the number of bytes occupied
               by the type @code{int}.

@item     sizeof(char)
Works out the number of bytes occupied by
               a single character. This equals 1, in fact.

@end table
 
    @code{sizeof(struct PersonalData)} works out the number of bytes needed
to store a single structure variable. Obviously this tool is very
useful for working with @code{malloc()}. The memory allocation statement
becomes something like:
@smallexample

   ptr = malloc(sizeof(type name));

@end smallexample
@noindent
There is a problem with this statement though: @code{malloc()} is declared as
a function which returns a type `pointer to character' whereas, here,
the programmer is interested in pointers of type "pointer to struct
Something". @code{malloc()} has to be forced to produce a pointer of the
correct type then and this is done by using the cast operator to mould
it into shape. The cast operator casts pointers with a general form:
@smallexample

   (type *) @code{value}

@end smallexample
@noindent
Consider the following example of C source code which allocates space
for a structure type called @code{SomeStruct} and creates a correctly
aligned pointer to it, called @code{ptr}.
@smallexample

  struct SomeStruct *ptr;
  char *malloc();

  ptr = (struct SomeStruct *) malloc(sizeof(struct Somestruct));

@end smallexample
@noindent
This rather laboured statement provides both the memory and the location
of that memory in a legal and type-sensical way.  The next chapter of
this book discusses what we can do with dynamically allocated
structures.

@node Unions, Questions 26, Creating Memory for Dynamical struct Types, Structures and Unions
@section Unions

@cindex Union
A @code{union} is like a structure in which all the `members' are stored
at the same address. Clearly they cannot all be there at the same time.
Only one member can be stored in such an object
at any one time, or it would be overwritten by another. Unions
behave like specially sized storage containers which can hold many
different types of data. A union can hold any one of its members but
only at different times.  The compiler arranges that a union type
variable is big enough to handle the job.

The real purpose of unions is to prevent memory fragmentation by
arranging for a standard size for data in the memory. By having
a standard data size we can guarantee that any hole left when
dynamically allocated memory is freed will always be reusable
by another instance of the same type of union. This is a natural
strategy in system programming where many instances of different
kinds of variables with a related purpose are stored dynamically.

@menu

@end menu

@node Declaration of union, Using unions, Unions, Unions
@subsection Declaration

A union is declared in the same way as a structure. It has a list
of members, which are used to mould the type of object concerned.
@smallexample

union IntOrFloat

   @{
   int ordinal;
   float continuous;
   @};

@end smallexample
@noindent
This declares a type template. Variables are then declared as:
@smallexample

union IntOrFloat x,y,z;

@end smallexample
@noindent
At different times the program is to treat @code{x},@code{y} and @code{z}
as being either integers or float types. When the variables are referred to as
@smallexample

     x.ordinal = 1;

@end smallexample
@noindent
the program sees @code{x} as being an integer type. At other times 
(when @code{x} is referred to as @code{x.continuous}) 
it takes on another aspect: its alter
ego, the float type. Notice that @code{x} by itself does not have a value:
only its members have values, @code{x} is just a box for the different
members to share.

@node Using unions,  , Declaration of union, Unions
@subsection Using unions

Unions are coded with the same constructions as structures. The dot @samp{.}
operator selects the different members for variable and the arrow @samp{->}
selects different values for pointers. The form of such statements is:
@smallexample

     union_variable.member;

     union_pointer->member;

@end smallexample
Unions are seldom very useful objects to have in programs, since
a program has no automatic way of knowing what type of member is
currently stored in the union type. One way to overcome this is to
keep a variable which signals the type currently held in the
variable. This is done very easily with the aid of enumerated data.
Consider the following kind of union:
@smallexample

union WhichType
   @{
   int ordinal;
   float continuous;
   char letter;
   @};

@end smallexample
@noindent
This could be accompanied by an enumerate declaration such as:
@smallexample

enum Types
   @{
   INT,
   FLOAT,
   CHAR
   @};

@end smallexample
@noindent
Variables could then go in pairs:
@smallexample

union WhichType x;
enum Types x_status;

@end smallexample
@noindent
which would make union type-handling straightforward:
@smallexample

switch (x_status)
   @{
   case INT   : x.ordinal = 12;
                break;
   case FLOAT : x.continuous = 12.23;
                break;
   case CHAR  : x.letter = '*';
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
These variables could even be grouped into a structure:
@smallexample

struct Union_Handler
   @{
   union WhichType x;
   enum Types x_status;
   @}
var;

@end smallexample
@noindent
which would then require statements such as:
@smallexample

var.x.ordinal = 2;

ptr->x.ordinal = 2;

var.x_status = CHAR;

@end smallexample
@noindent
and so on ...

@chapter Data Structures

@sp 1
@emph{Uses for struct variables. Structure diagrams.}
@sp 1

@cindex Data structures
Data structures are organized patterns of data. The purpose of
building a data structure is to create a pattern of information which
models a particular situation clearly and efficiently. Take the
simplest kind of data structure: the array.  Arrays are good for
storing patterns of information which look like tables, or share a
tabular structure. For example, a chess board looks like a two
dimensional array, so a chess game would naturally use a two
dimensional array to store the positions of pieces on the chess
board. The aim of a data structure is to model real life patterns with
program data.

Most real application programs require a more complex data
structure than C variables can offer; often arrays are not suitable
structures for a given application. To see this, consider an
application example in which a program stores a map of the local
countryside. This program has to store information about individual
towns and it has to be able to give directions to the user about how
to get to particular towns from some reference point. In real life,
all of this information is most easily conveyed by means of a map,
with towns' vital statistics written on it. (See figure 1.) The
diagram shows such a simplified map of the surrounding land. This sort
of map is, ideally, just what a computer ought to be able to
store. The handicap is that the map does not look very computerish. If
the map is ever going to be stored in a computer it will need to look
more mechanical. A transformation is needed. In order to make the map
into a more computer-like picture, it must be drawn as a structure
diagram.

@image{img/27.1,12cm}

A structure diagram is a picture which shows how something is
connected up. Most often a structure diagram shows how a problem is
connected up by relating all the parts which go together to make it
up. In this case, the structure diagram just shows how program data
are related to each other.

@node Data Structure Diagrams, Tools, Data structures, Data structures
@section Data Structure Diagrams

    Now examine figure 2. This diagram is a data structure diagram: it
is a diagram which shows how boxes of data must relate to one another
in order to solve the problem of the towns map. It has been drawn,
quite deliberately, in a way which is intended to conjure up some
particular thoughts. The arrows tend to suggest that pointers will
play a role in the data structure. The blocks tend to suggest that
sealed capsules or @code{struct} type data will also play a role. Putting
these two together creates the idea of a `town structure' containing
pointers to neighbouring villages which lie on roads to the North,
South, East and West of the town, as well as the information about the
town itself. This town structure might look something like this:
@smallexample

struct Town
   @{
   struct Town *north;
   struct Town *south;
   struct Town *east;
   struct Town *west;
   struct LocalInfo help;
   @};

@end smallexample

@image{img/27.2,12cm}

Assume for now that @code{LocalInfo} is a structure which contains all the
information about a town required by the program. This part of the
information is actually irrelevant to the structure of the data
because it is hidden inside the sealed capsule. It is the pointers
which are the main items of concern because it is pointers which
contain information that enables a program to find its way around the
map very quickly. If the user of this imaginary application program
wished to know about the town to the north of one particular place,
the program would only have to refocus its attention on the new
structure which was pointed to by the struct member @code{north} and
similarly for other directions.

A data structure is built up, like a model, by connecting struct
type variables together with pointers: these are the building blocks.

By thinking of struct types and pointers in terms of pictures,
one begins to see how structures can be fashioned, in computer memory,
to look exactly like the problems which they represent.

What is interesting about data structure diagrams is the way in which
they resemble the structure diagrams of C programs, which were drawn in
chapter 7. There is a simple reason for this similarity: computer
programs are themselves just data structures in which the data are
program instructions and the pointers and sealed boxes are function
calls. The structure of a computer program is called a
hierachy. Sometimes the shape of data structures and programs are
identical; when this happens, a kind of optimum efficiency has been
reached in conceptual terms. Programs which behave exactly like their
data operate very simply. This is the reason why structure diagrams are
so useful in programming: a structure diagram is a diagram which solves
a problem and does so in a pictorial way, which models the way we think.

@node Tools, Programme For Building Data Structures, Data Structure Diagrams, Data structures
@section The Tools: Structures, Pointers and Dynamic Memory

The tools of the data structure trade are struct types and
pointers.  Data structures are built out of dynamically allocated
memory, so storage places do not need names: all a program needs to do
is to keep a record of a pointer, to a particular storage space, and
the computer will be able to find it at any time after that. Pointers
are the keys which unlock a program's data. The reader might object to
this by saying that a pointer has to be stored in some C variable
somewhere, so does a program really gain anything from working with
pointers? The answer is yes, because pointers in data structures are
invariably chained together to make up the structure. To understand
this, make a note of the following terms:

@table @emph
@item     Root 
 This is a place where a data structure
                 starts. Every chain has to start somewhere.
                 The address of the root of a data structure
                 has to be stored explicitly in a C
                 variable.

@item     Links        
 A link is a pointer to a new struct type.
                 Links are used to chain structures
                 together. The address of the next element
                 in a chain structure is stored inside the
                 previous structure.

@end table

Data structures do not have to be linear chains and they are
often not. Structures, after all, can hold any number of pointers to
other structures, so there is the potential to branch out into any
number of new structures. In the map example above, there were four
pointers in each structure, so the chaining was not linear, but more
like a latticework.

We need to think about where and how data structures are
going to be stored. Remember that pointers alone do not create any
storage space: they are only a way of finding out the contents of
storage space which already exists. In fact, a program must create its
own space for data structures. The key phrase is dynamic
storage: a program makes space for structures as new ones are required
and deletes space which it does not require. The functions which
perform this memory allocation and release are:
@smallexample

     malloc()        @var{and}         free()

@end smallexample
There are some advantages which go with the use of dynamic
storage for data structures and they are summarized by the following
points:

@itemize @bullet
@item    Since memory is allocated as it is needed, the only
     restriction on data size is the memory capacity of
     the computer. We don't need to declare how much we shall
use in advance.

@item    Using pointers to connect structures means that they
     can be re-connected in different ways as the need
     arises. (Data structures can be sorted, for example.)

@item    Data structures can be made up of lots of "lesser"
     data structures, each held inside struct type storage.
     The limitations are few.

@end itemize

The remaining parts of this chapter aim to provide a basic plan
or formula for putting data structures together in C. This is done
with recourse to two example structures, which become two example
programs in a later chapter.

@node Programme For Building Data Structures, Setting Up A Data Structure, Tools, Data structures
@section Programme For Building Data Structures

In writing programs which centre around their data, such as word
processors, accounts programs or database managers, it is extremely
important to plan data structures before any program code is written:
changes in program code do not affect a data structure, but
alterations to a data structure imply drastic changes to program
code. Only in some numerical applications does a data structure
actually assist an algorithm rather than vice versa.
The steps which a programmer would undertake in designing a data
structure follow a basic pattern:

@itemize @bullet
@item  Group all the data, which must be stored, together
     and define a struct type to hold them.

@item  Think of a pattern which reflects the way in which
     the data are connected and add structure pointers
     to the struct definition, to connect them.

@item  Design the programming algorithms to handle the
     memory allocation, link pointers and data storage.

@end itemize

@node Setting Up A Data Structure, Example Structures, Programme For Building Data Structures, Data structures
@section Setting Up A Data Structure

Once the basic mould has been cast for the building blocks, a
program actually has to go through the motions of putting all the
pieces together, by connecting structures together with pointers and
filling them up with information. The data structure is set up by
repeating the following actions as many times as is necessary.

@itemize @bullet
@item    Define a struct type. For example:
@smallexample

     struct Town
        @{
        struct Town *north;
        struct Town *south;
        struct Town *east;
        struct Town *west;
        struct LocalInfo help;
        @};

@end smallexample

@item    Declare two pointers to this type:
@smallexample

     struct Town *ptr,*root;

@end smallexample
@noindent
     One of these is used to hold the root of the data
     structure and the other is used as a current pointer.

@item   Allocate memory for one structure type:

@smallexample

     root = (struct Town *) malloc(sizeof(struct Town));

@end smallexample
     Be careful to check for errors. root will be NULL if
     no memory could be allocated.

@item    Initialize the members of the structure with statements
     such as:
@smallexample

  root->north = NULL;
  root->south = NULL; 
  root->help.age = 56;  /* if age is a member  */
                        /* of struct LocalInfo */

@end smallexample
@noindent
     This sets the pointers @code{north} and @code{south} to the value
     @code{NULL}, which conventionally means that the pointer does
     not point anywhere.

@item   When other structures have been created, the pointers
     can be assigned to them:
@smallexample

   ptr = (struct Town *) malloc(sizeof(struct Town));
   ptr->north = NULL;
   ptr->south = NULL;

   /* etc. initialize members */

   root->north = ptr;

@end smallexample

This last statement connects the new structure onto the north
branch of root.

@end itemize

@image{img/27.4,12cm}

@code{NULL} pointer assignments tell the program handling the data
structure when it has come to the edge of the structure: that is when
it has found a pointer which doesn't lead anywhere.

@node Example Structures, Questions 27, Setting Up A Data Structure, Data structures
@section Example Structures

@cindex Binary tree
@cindex Linked list
Two data structures of this kind are very common:
the @emph{linked list} and the @code{binary tree} and both work upon the
principles outlined above (In fact they are just different
manifestations of the same thing.)

A linked list is a linear sequence of structures joined
together by pointers. If a structure diagram were drawn of a linked
list, all the storage blocks in it would lie in a straight line,
without branching out.

@smallexample

struct list
   @{
   double value;
   struct list *succ;
   @};

@end smallexample
@noindent
A linked list has only a single pointer per structure, which points to
the successor in the list. If the blocks were labelled A, B, C, D, E, ... then
B would be the successor of A; C would be the successor of B and so on.
Linked lists have two advantages over one dimensional arrays: they can
be sorted easily (see diagram) and they can be made any length at all.

A binary tree is a sequence of structures, each of which branches
out into two new ones.
@smallexample

struct BinaryTree 
   @{
   /* other information */

   struct BinaryTree *left;
   struct BinaryTree *right;
   @}
 
  *tree = NULL;

@end smallexample
@noindent
A binary tree structure has two pointers per struct type. This is useful
for classifying data on a greater than/less than basis. 

@image{img/27.5,12cm}

Right and left
branches are taken to mean `greater than' and `less than' respectively.
The programs which handle these data structures are written in the form
of complete, usable application programs. They are simple by
professional standards, but they are long by book standards so they are
contained in a chapter by themselves, along with their accompanying
programmers' documentation, @xref{Example Programs}.

@cindex Recursion
This chapter is about program structures which can talk about
themselves. What happens to a function which makes a call to itself?
Examine the function below:
@smallexample

  Well_Function ()

  @{
  /* ... other statements ... */

  Well_Function ();
  @}

@end smallexample
@code{Well_Function()} is said to be a recursive function. It is defined
in terms of itself: it contains itself and it calls itself. It
swallows its own tail! The act of self-reference is called
recursion. What happens to such a function when it is called in a C
program? In the simple example above, something dramatic and fatal
happens. The computer, naturally, begins executing the statements in
the function, inside the curly braces. This much is only normal:
programs are designed to do this and the computer could do no more and
no less. Eventually the program comes upon the statement
@code{Well_Function();} and it makes a call to that function again. It then
begins executing statements in @code{Well_function()}, from the beginning, as
though it were a new function, until it comes upon the statement
@code{Well_Function()} and then it calls the function again ...


This kind of function calling scenario is doomed to continue
without end, as, each time the function is called, it is inevitably
called again. The computer becomes totally consumed with the task of
calling @code{Well_Function()} over and over. It is apparently doomed to
repeat the same procedure for ever. Or is it?

@section Functions and The Stack

@cindex Stack
We should think about the exact sequence of events which takes place
when a function is called in a program. This will help to cast some
light on the mechanics of recursion and recursive functions.  When a
function is called, control passes from one place in a program to
another place. The statements in this new region of the program are
carried out and then control returns to a statement immediately
following the one which made the function call. But how does the
computer know where it must go back to, when it has finished with a
function call? It is suddenly thrown into a wildly different region of
the memory and finds itself executing statements there. How can it get
back again? A diagram does not answer this question: program structure
diagrams hide this detail from view.

@image{img/28.1,12cm}

@smallexample

      function1()

        /    \
       /      \

 function2()   function3()

  /    \          /    \


@end smallexample
@noindent
The answer to this puzzle is that the computer keeps a record of
the addresses of the places to which it must return, no matter how
many times functions are called. It does this by building a special
data structure called a @code{stack}.

@image{img/28.2,12cm}

A stack is quite literally a pile of data, organized in the
memory. Information is placed on top of a stack and taken from the
top. It is called a @emph{last in, first out} (LIFO) structure because
the last thing to go on the top of a stack is always the first thing to
come off it. C organizes a stack structure when it runs a program and
uses it for storing local variables and for keeping track of where it
has to return to. When it calls a function, it leaves itself a reminder,
on the top of its program stack, which tells it where it has to go to
when it has finished executing that function. C management makes sure
that it does not put anything else on top of that reminder to spoil the
flow of control. When a function is finished, the program takes the
first message from the top of the stack and carries on executing
statements at the place specified by the message. Normally this method
works perfectly, without any problems at all: functions are called and
they return again; the stack grows and shrinks and all is well.

What happens when a recursive function, like @code{Well_Function()}
calls itself? The system works as normal. C makes a note of the place it
has to return to and puts that note on top of the stack. It then begins
executing statements. When it comes to the call @code{Well_Function()}
again, it makes a new note of where it has to come back to and deposits
it on top of the stack. It then begins the function again and when it
finds the function call, it makes a new note and puts it on the top of the
stack ... As this process continues, the memory gets filled up with the
program's messages to itself: the stack of messages gets larger and
larger. Since the function has no chance of returning control to its
caller, the messages never get taken off the stack and it just builds
up. Eventually the computer runs out of memory and the computer crashes
or interrupts the program with a fatal error message.

@node Levels and Wells, Tame Recursion and Self-Similarity, Functions and The Stack, Recursion
@section Levels and Wells

A stack is made up of frames or levels. Each time a function is
called, the program is said to drop down a level. This is the reason
for structure comments like:

in the programs in this book. The @code{main()} function is at level 0
because it is the root of the program. If @code{main()} calls any functions
at all, control drops down to level one. When a level one function
returns, it hands control back to level zero. These level numbers
actually count the height of the program stack at any point in a
program. The level number is the number of messages or reminders on
the stack.

A function like @code{Well_Function()} digs itself a well of infinite
depth. It punches a great hole in a program; it has no place in a
levelled structure diagram. The function is pathological because it causes
the stack to fill up the memory of the computer. A better name for this
function would be:

@section Tame Recursion and Self-Similarity

Recursion does not have to be so dramatically disastrous as the
example given. If recursion is tamed, it provides perhaps the most
powerful way of handling certain kinds of problem in programming,
particularly concerning data structures.

Earlier we remarked that programs and data structures
aim to model the situation they deal with as closely as possible. Some
problems are made up of many levels of detail (see the introduction to
this tutorial) and the details are identical at all levels. Since
recursion is about functions which contain themselves at all levels,
this tends to suggest that recursion would be useful for dealing with
these self-similar problems. Data structures are prime candidates for
this because they are made up of identical structure types, connected
together in a way which makes them look like programs connected up by
function calls.

Recursive functions can be tamed by making sure that there is a
safe way to exit them, so that recursion only happens under particular
circumstances. The aim is to control the number of times that
recursion takes place by making a decision about what happens in the
function: the decision about whether a function calls itself or
not. For example, it is easy to make @code{Well_Function} recurse four
times only, by making a test:
@smallexample

Well_Function(nooftimes)

int nooftimes;

@{
if (nooftimes == 0)
   @{
   return (0);
   @}
else
   @{
   Well_Function(nooftimes-1);
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
A call of @code{WellFunction(4)} would make this function drop down four
stack levels and then return. Notice the way in which the if ... else
statement shields the program from the recursion when @code{nooftimes}
equals zero. It effectively acts as a safety net, stopping the
program from plunging down the well of levels infinitely.

@section Simple Example without a Data Structure

A completely standard example of controlled recursion is the factorial
(or Gamma) function.  This is a mathematical function which is important
in statistics. (Mathematicians also deal with recursive functions;
computer programs are not alone in this.)  The factorial function is
defined to be the "product" (multiplication) of all the natural
(unsigned integer) numbers from 1 to the parameter of the function. For
example:
@smallexample

 factorial(4) == 1 * 2 * 3 * 4               == 24

 factorial(6) == 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6       == 720

@end smallexample
@noindent
Formally, the factorial function is defined by two mathematical
statements:
@smallexample

factorial (n) = n * factorial(n-1)

@end smallexample
@noindent
and
@smallexample

factorial (0) = 1

@end smallexample
@noindent
The first of these statements is recursive, because it defines
the value of @code{factorial(n)} in terms of the factorial function of
@math{(n-1)}. This strange definition seems to want to lift itself by its
very bootstraps! The second statement saves it, by giving it a
reference value. The factorial function can be written down
immediately, as a controlled recursive function:
@smallexample

factorial (n)

unsigned int n;

@{
if (n == 0)
   @{
   return (1);
   @}
else
   @{
   return (n * factorial(n-1)); 
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
To see how this works, try following it through for n equals
three. The statement:
@smallexample

  factorial (3);

@end smallexample
@noindent
causes a call to be made to @code{factorial()}. The value of @code{n} is set to
three. @code{factorial()} then tests whether @code{n} is zero (which it is not) so
it takes the alternative branch of the @samp{if ... else} statement. This
instructs it to return the value of:
@smallexample

  3 * factorial(3-1)

@end smallexample
@noindent
In order to calculate that, the function has to call factorial
recursively, passing the value (3-1) or 2 to the new call. The new
call takes this value, checks whether it is zero (it is not) and tries
to return the value @code{2 * factorial(1)}. In order to work this out, it
needs to call factorial again, which checks that n is not 0 (it is
not) and so tries to return @code{1 * factorial(0)}. Finally, it calls
@code{factorial(0)} which does not call factorial any more, but starts
unloading the stack and returning the values. The expression goes
through the following steps before finally being evaluated:
@smallexample

factorial (3) == 3 * factorial(2)
              == 3 * (2 * factorial(1))
              == 3 * (2 * (1 * factorial(0)))
              == 3 * (2 * (1 * 1)))

              == 3 * 2 * 1 * 1

@end smallexample
@noindent
Try to write this function without using recursion and compare
the two.

@node Simple Example With a Data Structure, Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion, Simple Example without a Data Structure, Recursion
@section Simple Example With a Data Structure

A data structure earns the name recursive if its structure looks
identical at every point within it. The simplest recursive structure
is the linked list. At every point in a linked list, there are some
data of identical type and one pointer to the next structure. The next
simplest structure is the binary tree: this structure splits into two
at every point. It has two pointers, one which branches left and one
which branches to the right. Neither of these structures goes on for
ever, so it seems reasonable to suppose that they might be handled
easily using controlled recursive functions.

@code{deletetoend()} is a function which releases the dynamic memory
allocated to a linked list in one go. The problem it faces is this: if
it deletes the first structure in the list, it will lose information
about where the rest of the list is, because the pointer to the
successor of a structure is held in its predecessor. It must therefore
make a note of the pointer to the next structure in the list, before
it deletes that structure, or it will never be able to get beyond the
first structure in the list. The solution is to delete the list
backwards from last to first using the following recursive routine.
@smallexample

/* structure definition */

struct list
   @{
   /* some other data members */
   struct list *succ;
   @};

/**************************************************************/

struct list *deletetoend (ptr)

struct list *ptr;

@{
if (ptr != NULL)
   @{
   deletetoend (ptr->succ);
   releasestruct (ptr);
   @}
return (NULL);
@}

/**************************************************************/

releasestruct (ptr)         /* release memory back to pool */

struct list *ptr;

@{
if (free((char *) ptr) != 0)
   @{
   printf ("Debug: memory release failure\n");
   @}
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
We supply a pointer to the place we would like the list to
end. This need not be the very beginning: it could be any place in the
list. The function then eliminates all structures after that point, up
to the end of the list. It does assume that the programmer has been
careful to ensure that the end of the list is marked by a @code{NULL}
pointer. This is the conventional way of denoting a pointer which does
not point anywhere. If the pointer supplied is already @code{NULL} then this
function does nothing. If it is not @code{NULL} then it executes the statements
enclosed by the @code{if} braces. Notice that @code{deletetoend()} calls
itself immediately, passing its successor in the list as a
parameter. @code{(ptr->succ)} The function keeps doing this until it
finds the end on the list. The very last-called @code{deletetoend()}
then reaches the statement @code{releasestruct()} which frees the memory
taken up by the last structure and hands it back to the free memory
pool. That function consequently returns and allows the second-last
@code{deletetoend()} to reach the @code{releasestruct()} statement,
releasing the second last structure (which is now on the end of the
list). This, in turn, returns and the process continues until the entire
list has been deleted. The function returns the value @code{NULL} at each
stage, so that when called, @code{deletetoend()} offers a very elegant
way of deleting part or all of a linked list:
@smallexample

  struct list *newlast;

  newlast->succ = deletetoend (newlast->succ);

  ptr = deletetoend (ptr);

@end smallexample
@noindent
newlast then becomes the new end of the list, and its successor is
NULLified in a single statement.

@section Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion

@cindex Global variables and recursion
@cindex Recursion and global variables
Why should programmers want to clutter up programs with
techniques as mind boggling as recursion at all?
The great advantage of recursion is that it makes functions very
simple and allows them to behave just like the thing they are
attempting to model. Unfortunately there are few situations in which
recursion can be employed in a practical way. The major disadvantage
of recursion is the amount of memory required to make it work: do not
forget that the program stack grows each time a function call is
made. If a recursive function buried itself a thousand levels deep, a
program would almost certainly run out of memory. There is also the
slight danger that a recursive function will go out of control if a
program contains bugs.

@node Recursion and Global Variables, Questions 28, Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion, Recursion
@section Recursion and Global Variables

Global variables and recursion do not mix well. Most recursive
routines only work because they are sealed capsules and what goes on
inside them can never affect the outside world. The only time that
recursive functions should attempt to alter global storage is when the
function concerned operates on a global data structure, as in the
example above. To appreciate the danger, consider a recursive
function, in which a second function @code{alterGLOBAL()} accidentally alters
the value of @code{GLOBAL} in the middle of the function:
@smallexample

int GLOBAL = -2;

recursion ()

@{
if (++GLOBAL == 0)
   @{
   return (0);
   @}

alterGLOBAL();  /* another function which alters GLOBAL */
recursion();
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This function is treading a fine line between safety and digging its own
recursive grave. If @code{alterGLOBAL()} makes @code{GLOBAL} more
negative, as fast as @code{++} can make it more positive then @code{GLOBAL}
will never be able to satisfy the condition of being zero and it will go
on making recursive calls, never returning. If @code{alterGLOBAL()}
makes the mistake of setting @code{GLOBAL} to a positive value, then the
@code{++} operator in @code{recursion()} can only make @code{GLOBAL}
larger and it will never be able to satisfy the condition that
@code{GLOBAL == 0} and so again the function would never be able to
return. The stack would fill up the memory and the program would plunge
down an unending recursive well.

If local variables and parameters are used instead, this
difficulty can be controlled much more easily. @code{alterGLOBAL()} cannot
alter a variable in @code{recursion()} by accident, if only local variables
are used, because it only works with its own local copies of
parameters and variables which are locked away in a sealed capsule,
out of harm's way.

@node Statistical Data Handler, Listing stat, Example Programs, Example Programs
@section Statistical Data Handler

The first program is a utility which allows the user to type sets
of floating point data into an editor and to calculate the mean,
standard deviation and so on, of those data. The program is capable
of loading and saving the data to disk, as well as being able to
handle several sets of data at once. The editor works in insert or
overwrite modes.
The program is menu driven and its operation should be reasonably
self explanatory, so it is presented with rather sparse documentation.

@menu
* The editor::                  
* Insert Overwrite::            
* Quitting section::            
* Program listing stat::        
@end menu

@node The editor, Insert Overwrite, Statistical Data Handler, Statistical Data Handler
@subsection The Editor


A simple machine independent editor is provided for entering
data. The editor first asks the user whether the current number of
sets of data is to be altered. The default value is zero so, when data
are typed in for the first time, this should be set up, by responding
Y for yes. Up to twenty independent sets of data can be used. This
number is set at the start and it is held in the memory and saved to
disk with data files. If the number of sets is reduced at any time,
the top sets are cut off from the calculations, but they are not
lost forever, provided the number is changed back to include them
before they are saved to disk, since the number of sets is used as an
upper bound in a for loop: it does not actually alter the memory. More
sets can be added at any time by making this value larger.

@node Insert Overwrite, Quitting section, The editor, Statistical Data Handler
@subsection  Insert/Overwrite

A project file can be edited in either insert mode or overwrite
mode. Files which contain no data may only be edited in insert mode. The
editor senses this and selects the mode automatically. In insert mode
the user is prompted for values. Type 0.0 in place of an entry to get
out of this mode.  In overwrite mode the user is offered each entry in
turn. If a non digit character is typed in (such as a @samp{.} (dot) or
a @samp{-} (dash) etc) the value of an entry is not altered. However,
if a new value is entered, the new value will replace the old one. By
default, the values are offered in turn from 1 to the final
value. However, on selecting overwrite mode, the user is prompted for a
starting value, and the values are offered from the starting number to
the end. This is to avoid the rather tedious process of working through
all the entries which are not required in a system independent way.

@node Quitting section, Program listing stat, Insert Overwrite, Statistical Data Handler
@subsection  Quitting Sections

When quitting sections in which the user is supposed to enter
data, the convention is that typing a zero value (0.0 for a time, 0 in
any other instance) is a signal to break out of a section. Typing 0.0
while editing in insert mode causes the editor to quit.

@node Program listing stat,  , Quitting section, Statistical Data Handler
@subsection The Program Listing

The program includes three library files, which are used for the
following purposes.

@table @code
@item    #include <stdio.h>
   Standard I/O header file
@item    #include <ctype.h>
   Contains character ID macros
@item    #include <math.h>
    Includes math function declarations

@end table

The flow of program logic is most easily described by means of a
program structure diagram. The diagram shows the structure of function
calls within the program and this can be related to the listing.
The general scheme of the program is this:

@image{img/30.1,12cm}

@enumerate
@item
Various flags concerning the data structure are cleared.

@item
  A menu is printed and the program cycles through the menu
  options.

@item
  The editor determines the data group to be edited, updates
  the screen with the data in the current group and loops
  through insert or overtype editing until the user quits.

@item
  The analysis calls custom functions which scan through the
  data structure calculating the relevant quantities.

@item
  Various toolkits perform run of the mill activities.

@end enumerate
The data structure of this program is an array of linked
lists. The array provides the roots of several independent linked
lists: one for each group of data. These linked lists are attended to
by toolkit routines and by special functions such as @code{over()}.

@section Variable Cross Referencer

A variable cross referencer is a utility which produces a list of all
the identifiers in a C program (variables, macros, functions, ...) and
lists the line numbers of those identifiers within the source file. This
is sometimes useful for finding errors and for spotting variables,
functions and macros which are never used, since they show up clearly as
identifiers which have only a single reference. The program is listed
here, with its line numbers, and its output (applied to itself) is
supplied afterwards for reference. The structure diagram illustrates the
operation of the program.

This simplified program could be improved in a number of
ways. Here are some suggestions for improvement:

@itemize @bullet
@item  The program could determine whether an identifier was
     of type pointer or not and, if so, label the line
     number with a *, e.g.  *123 342 *1234

@item   At present the program only marks macros with a #
     symbol on the line at which they are defined. It could
     be made to mark them at every line, so that #undef-ined
     symbols and variables were clearly distinguished.

@cindex Errors, diagnosing
@cindex Debugging
Debugging can be a difficult process. In many cases compiler
errors are not generated because of the error reported by the compiler,
but because the compiler got out of step.  Often the error messages
give a completely misleading impression of what has gone wrong. It is
useful therefore to build a list of errors and probable causes
personally. These few examples here should help beginners get started
and perhaps give some insight into the way C works.

@node Missing semicolon;, Missing brace, Compiler Trappable Errors, Compiler Trappable Errors
@subsection Missing semicolon;

A missing semicolon is easily trapped by the compiler. Every
statement must end with a semi colon. A compound statement which is
held in curly braces seldom needs a semi colon to follow.
@smallexample

     statement;
but:
     @{
     @}; <-- This semi colon is only needed if the curly
            braces enclose a type declaration or an
            initializer for static array/structure etc.
@end smallexample

@node Missing brace, Mistyping Upper Lower Case, Missing semicolon;, Compiler Trappable Errors
@subsection Missing closing brace @code{@}}

This error is harder to spot and may cause a whole host of
irrelevant and incorrect errors after the missing brace. Count braces
carefully. One way to avoid this is to always fill braces in before
the statements are written inside them. So write
@smallexample

@{

@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
and fill in the statements afterwards. Often this error will generate
a message like `unexpected end of file' because it is particularly
difficult for a compiler to diagnose.

@node Mistyping Upper Lower Case, Missing inv comma, Missing brace, Compiler Trappable Errors
@subsection Mistyping Upper/Lower Case

C distinguishes between small and capital letters. If a program
fails at the linking stage because it has found a reference to a
function which had not been defined, this is often the cause.

@node Missing inv comma, Variable not declared or scope wrong, Mistyping Upper Lower Case, Compiler Trappable Errors
@subsection Missing quote @code{"}

If a quote is missed out of a statement containing a string then
the compiler will usually signal this with a message like:
@smallexample

String too long or unterminated.

@end smallexample

@node Variable not declared or scope wrong, Using a function or assignment inside a macro, Missing inv comma, Compiler Trappable Errors
@subsection Variable not declared or scope wrong

This means that a variable is used which has not first been
declared, or that a variable is used outside of its sealed
capsule.

@node Using a function or assignment inside a macro, Forgetting to declare a function which is not type int, Variable not declared or scope wrong, Compiler Trappable Errors
@subsection Using a function or assignment inside a macro

If @code{abs (x)} is a macro and not a function then the following are
incorrect:
@smallexample

abs (function());
abs (x = function());

@end smallexample
@noindent
Only a single variable can be substituted into a macro. This error
might generate something like "lvalue required".

@node Forgetting to declare a function which is not type int, Type mismatch in expressions, Using a function or assignment inside a macro, Compiler Trappable Errors
@subsection Forgetting to declare a function which is not type int

All functions return values of @code{int} by default. If it is required
that they return another type of variable, this must be declared in
two places: 

a) In the function which calls the new function, along
with the other declarations:
@smallexample

CallFunction ()

@{ char ch, function1(), *function2();

@}

@end smallexample
The @code{function1()} is type @code{char}; @code{function2()} 
is type pointer to
char. 

b) This must also be declared where the function is defined:
@smallexample

char function1 ()

@{
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
and
@smallexample

char *function2()

@{
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This error might result in the message "type mismatch" or "external
variable/function type/attribute mismatch"

@node Type mismatch in expressions,  , Forgetting to declare a function which is not type int, Compiler Trappable Errors
@subsection Type mismatch in expressions

There is a rule in C that all maths operations have to be
performed with long variables. These are
@smallexample

int
long int

double
long float

@end smallexample
@noindent
The result is also a long type. If the user forgets this and tries to
use short C automatically converts it into long form. The result
cannot therefore be assigned to a short type afterwards or the
compiler will complain that there is a type mismatch. So the following
is wrong:
@smallexample

short i,j = 2;

i = j * 2;

@end smallexample
@noindent
If a short result is required, the cast operator has to be used to
cast the long result to be a short one.
@smallexample

short i,j = 2;

i = (short) j * 2;

@node Confusion of = and ==, Missing & in scanf, Run time errors, Run time errors
@subsection Confusion of @code{=} and @code{==}

A statement such as:
@smallexample

if (a = 0)
   @{
   @}

@end smallexample
@noindent
is valid C, but notice that @code{=} is the assignment operator and not the
equality operator @code{==}. It is legal to put an assignment inside the if
statement (or any other function) and the value of the assignment is
the value being assigned! So writing the above would always give the
result zero (which is `FALSE' in C) so the contents of the braces @code{@{@}}
would never be executed. To compare a to zero the correct syntax is:
@smallexample

if (a == 0)
   @{
   @}

@end smallexample

@node Missing & in scanf, Confusing C++ and ++C, Confusion of = and ==, Run time errors
@subsection Missing @code{&} in @code{scanf}

This error can often be trapped by a compiler, but not in all
cases. The arguments of the scanf statement must be pointers or
addresses of variables, not the contents of the variables
themselves. Thus the following is wrong:
@smallexample

int i;
char ch;

scanf ("%c %d",ch,i);

@end smallexample
@noindent
and should read:
@smallexample

int i;
char;

scanf ("%c %d", &ch, &i);

@end smallexample
@noindent
Notice however that the @samp{&} is not always needed if the identifier in
the expression is already a pointer. The following is correct:
@smallexample

int *i;
char *ch;

scanf ("%c %d", ch, i);

@end smallexample
@noindent
Including the @code{&} now would be wrong. If this error is trappable then it
will be something like "Variable is not a pointer".

@node Confusing C++ and ++C, Unwarranted assumptions about storage of arrays/structures, Missing & in scanf, Run time errors
@subsection Confusing C++ and ++C

In many cases these two forms are identical. However, if they are
hidden inside another statement e.g.
@smallexample

array [C++] = 0;

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
then there is a subtle
difference. @code{++C} causes @code{C} to be incremented by 1 before
the assignment takes place whereas @code{C++} causes @code{C} to be
incremented by 1 after the assignment has taken place. So if you find
that a program is out of step by 1, this could be the cause.

@node Unwarranted assumptions about storage of arrays/structures, Number of actual and formal parameters does not match, Confusing C++ and ++C, Run time errors
@subsection Unwarranted assumptions about storage of arrays/structures

C stores arrays in rows, and as far as the language is concerned
the storage locations are next to one another in one place up to the
end of the array. This might not be exactly true,
in general. A program will be loaded into one or more areas (wherever the operating system can find space) and new variable space will
be found wherever it is available, but this will not generally be in
whole blocks `side by side' in the memory. The following sort of
construction only works for simple data types:
@smallexample

char array[10];

*array = 0;
*(array + 1) = 0;
...
*(array + 9) = 0;

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
While it is true that the variable "array"
used without its square brackets is a pointer to the first element of
the array, it is not necessarily true that the array will be stored in this way. Using:
@smallexample

char array[10];

array[0] = 0;
array[1] = 0;
...
array[9] = 0;


@end smallexample
@noindent
is safe. When finding a pointer to, say, the fourth element, you should not
assume that
@smallexample

array + 3

@end smallexample
will be the location. Use:
@smallexample

&(array[3])

@end smallexample

Do not assume that the size of a structure is the sum of the sizes of
its parts! There may be extra data inside for operating system use or
for implementation reasons, like aligning variables with particular
addresses.

@node Number of actual and formal parameters does not match, Conversion string in scanf or printf wrong, Unwarranted assumptions about storage of arrays/structures, Run time errors
@subsection The number of actual and formal parameters does not match

This problem can be avoided in ANSI C and C++ but not in K&R C.  When
passing values to a function the compiler will not spot whether you have
the wrong number of parameters in a statement, provided they are all of
the correct type. The values which are assumed for missing parameters
cannot be guaranteed. They are probably garbage and will most likely
spoil a program.

@node Conversion string in scanf or printf wrong, Accidental confusion of int short and char, Number of actual and formal parameters does not match, Run time errors
@subsection The conversion string in @code{scanf}/@code{printf} is wrong

Incorrect I/O can be the result of poorly matched conversion strings
in I/O statements. For example:
@smallexample

float x;
scanf ("%d",&x);

@end smallexample
@noindent

should be:

@smallexample

float x;
scanf ("%f",&x);

@end smallexample
@noindent

and:
@smallexample

double x;
scanf  ("%f",&x);

@end smallexample
@noindent

should be:
@smallexample

double x;
scanf  ("%lf",&x);

@end smallexample

Another effect which can occur if the conversion specifier is
selected as being long when the variable is really short is that
neighbouring variables can receive the scanf values instead!  For
instance if two variables of the same type happen to be stored next to
each other in the memory:
@smallexample

short i,j;

@end smallexample
@noindent
which might look like:
@smallexample

--------------------------------------
|                  |                 |
--------------------------------------

         i                  j

@end smallexample
@noindent
and the user tries to read into one with a long int value, @code{scanf} will
store a long int value, which is the size of two of these @code{short}
variables. Suppose the left hand box were @code{i} and the right hand box
were @code{j} and you wanted to input the value of @code{i}: instead of getting:
@smallexample

             --------------------
            |  002345  |         |
             --------------------

                 i         j
@end smallexample
@noindent
@code{scanf} might store
@smallexample

0000000000000002345

@end smallexample
@noindent
as
@smallexample
           ------------------------
          | 000000000 | 0000002345 |
           ------------------------

                i           j

@end smallexample 
@noindent 
because the value was long, but this would mean that the number would
over flow out of @code{i} into @code{j} and in fact @code{j} might get
the correct value and @code{i} would be set to zero!! Check the
conversion specifiers!!

@node Accidental confusion of int short and char, Arrays out of bounds, Conversion string in scanf or printf wrong, Run time errors
@subsection Accidental confusion of @code{int}, @code{short} and @code{char}

Often when working with characters one also wants to know their ASCII
values. If characters/integers are passed as parameters it is easy to
mistype @code{char} for @code{int} etc. The compiler probably won't
notice this because no conversion is needed between @code{int} and
@code{char}. Characters are stored by their ASCII values. On the other hand if
the declaration is wrong:
@smallexample

function (ch)

int (ch);

@{
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
but the character is continually assumed to be a character by the
program, a crashworthy routine might be the result.

@node Arrays out of bounds, Mathematical Errors, Accidental confusion of int short and char, Run time errors
@subsection Arrays out of bounds

C does not check the limits of arrays. If an
array is sized:
@smallexample

type array[5];

@end smallexample
@noindent
and you allow the program to write to @code{array[5]} or more, C
will not complain. However the computer might! In the worst case this
could cause the program to crash.

@node Mathematical Errors, Uncoordinated Output using put/get I/O, Arrays out of bounds, Run time errors
@subsection Mathematical Errors

C does not necessarily signal mathematical errors. A program
might continue regardless of the fact that a mathematical function
failed. Some mathematical errors (often subtle ones) can be caused
by forgetting to include the file @file{math.h} at the start of the
program.

@node Uncoordinated Output using put/get I/O, Global Variables and Recursion, Mathematical Errors, Run time errors
@subsection Uncoordinated Output using buffered I/O

Output which is generated by functions like @code{putchar()},
@code{puts()} is buffered. This means that it is not written to the
screen until the buffer is either full or is specifically emptied. This
results in strange effects such as programs which produce no output
until all the input is complete (short programs) or spontaneous bursts
of output at uncoordinated intervals. One cure is to terminate with a
newline @samp{\n} character which flushes the buffers on each write
operation. Special functions on some systems such as @code{getch()} may
also suffer from this problem. Again the cure is to write:
@smallexample

   printf ("\n");
   ch = getch();

@end smallexample

@node Global Variables and Recursion,  , Uncoordinated Output using put/get I/O, Run time errors
@subsection Global Variables and Recursion

Global variables and recursion should not be mixed. Most
recursive routines work only because they are sealed capsules and what
goes on inside them can never affect the outside world. The only time
that recursive functions should alter global storage is when the
function concerned operates on a global data structure. Consider a
recursive function:
@smallexample

int GLOBAL;

recursion ()

@{
if (++GLOBAL == 0)
   @{
   return (0);
   @}

alterGLOBAL();  /* another function which alters GLOBAL */
recursion();
@}

@end smallexample
@noindent
This function is treading a fine line between safety and digging its
own recursive grave. All it would take to crash the program, would be
the careless use of @code{GLOBAL} in the function @code{alterGLOBAL()} and the
function would never be able to return. The stack would fill up the
memory and the program would plunge down an unending recursive well.

@node Locating a problem,  , Tracing errors, Tracing errors
@subsection Locating a problem

Complex bugs can be difficult to locate. Here are some tips for
fault finding:

@enumerate
@item
  Try to use local variables, in preference to global
     ones for local duties. Never rely on global variables
     for passing messages between functions.

@item
  Check variable declarations and missing parameters.

@item
  Check that a program has not run out of private memory.
     (If it repeatedly crashes for no apparent reason, this
     could be a cause.) Make the program stack size
     bigger if that is possible.

@item
  Use statements like printf("program is now here") to
     map out the progress of a program and to check that all
     function calls are made correctly.

@item
  Use statements like ch = getchar() to halt a program
     in certain places and to find out the exact location
     at which things go wrong.

@item
  Try "commenting out" lines of suspect code. In other
     words: put comment markers around lines that you would
     like to eliminate temporarily and then recompile to
     pinpoint errors.

@item
  Check that the compiler disk has not been corrupted
     (make a new copy) -- getting desperate now!

@item
  Try retyping the program, or using a filter which
     strips out any illegal characters which might have
     found their way into a program.

@item
  Get some sleep! Hope the problem has gone away in the
     morning.

@end enumerate

Failing these measures, try to find someone who programs in C
regularly on the computer system concerned.

@node Pathological Problems, Porting Programs between computers, Tracing errors, Errors and debugging
@section Pathological Problems


Problems which defy reasonable explanations are called
pathological or `sick'. Sometimes these will be the result of
misconceptions about C functions, but occasionally they may be the
result of compiler bugs, or operating system design
peculiarities. Consider the following example which was
encountered while writing the simple example in the chapter on Files and
Devices, subsection `Low Level File Handling': in that program a
seemingly innocent macro defined by
@smallexample

#define CLRSCRN() putchar('\f');

@end smallexample
@noindent
caused the C library functions @code{creat()} and @code{remove()} to
fail in remarkable ways on an early Amiga C compiler! The problem was
that a single call to @code{CLRSCRN()} at the start of the function
@code{DelFile()} caused both of the library functions (in very different
parts of the program) above to make recursive function calls to the
function @code{DelFile()}. The deletion of @code{CLRSCRN()} cured the
problem entirely!  In general it is worth checking carefully the names
of all functions within a program to be sure that they do not infringe
upon library functions. For example, @code{read()} and @code{write()}
are names which everyone wishes to use at some point, but they are the
names of standard library functions, so they may not be used. Even
capitalizing (Read() / Write()) might not work: beware that special
operating system libraries have not already reserved these words as
library commands.

It is almost impossible to advise about these errors. A
programmer can only hope to try to eliminate all possibilities in
homing in on the problem. To misquote Sherlock Holmes: "At the end of
the day, when all else fails and the manuals are in the waste paper
basket, the last possibility, however improbable, has to be the
truth."

@node Porting Programs between computers, Questions 30, Pathological Problems, Errors and debugging
@section Porting Programs between computers

Programs written according to the style guidelines described in
this book should be highly portable. Nevertheless, there are almost
inevitably problems in porting programs from one computer to
another. The most likely area of incompatibility between compilers
regards filing operations, especially @code{scanf()}. Programmers attempting
to transfer programs between machines are recommended to look at all
the @code{scanf()} statements first and to check all the conversion
specifiers with a local compiler manual.  @code{scanf()} is capable of
producing a full spectrum of weird effects which have nothing to do
with I/O.
Here are some more potential problems to look out for:

@itemize @bullet
@item   Assumptions about the size of data objects such as
     int and float can be risky.

@item   Check conversion characters in @code{printf()} and @code{scanf()}
     as some compilers choose slightly different conventions
     for these.

@item   The stack size for (memory available to) a program
     is likely to vary between systems. This can cause
     errors at run time if a program runs out of space,
     even though there is nothing wrong with the code.

@item   Check for functions which rely on the speed of a
     particular computer. For example, pause() or wait
     loops. Some computers may
     scarcely notice counting to 50000, whereas others
     may labour at it for some time!

@item   Check for assumptions made about filenames. e.g.
     limited/unlimited size, valid characters etc.

@section Header Files and Libraries

Header files contain macro definitions, type definitions and
variable/ function declarations which are used in connection with
standard libraries. They supplement the object code libraries which
are linked at compile time for standard library functions. Some
library facilities are not available unless header files are
included. Typical names for header files are:

@table @file
@item   stdio.h
Standard I/O (libc).
@item   ctype.h
Macro for character types.
@item    math.h
Mathematical definitions (libm)

@section Statements

A single statement is any valid string in C which ends with a
semi colon. e.g.
@smallexample

a = 6;
printf ("I love C because ...");

@end smallexample
@noindent
A compound statement is any number of single statements grouped
together in curly braces. The curly braces do not end with a semi
colon and stand in place of a single statement. Any pair of curly
braces may contain local declarations after the opening brace. e.g.
@smallexample

@{
a = 6;
@}

@{ int a;

a = 6;
printf ("I love C because ...");
@}

recover gracefully) the form of the goto statement is as follows:

@appendix All the Reserved Words

Here is a list of all the reserved words in C.  They are used to build up the basic instructions of C; you cannot
use them as identifiers in programs you write

Please note that this list is somewhat misleading.  Many more words are
out of bounds.  This is because most of the facilities which C offers
are in libraries that are included in programs.  Once a library has been
included in a program, its functions are defined and you cannot use
their names yourself.

C requires all of these reserved words to be in lower
case. (This does mean that, typed in upper case, the reserved words
could be used as variable names, but this is not recommended.)

(A "d" by the word implies that it is used as part of a
declaration.)

@smallexample

construction. The loop constructions of C are far superior to those of
either BASIC or Pascal however. Input and Output in C is more flexible
than Pascal, though correspondingly less robust in terms of program
crashability. Input and Output in C can match all of the string
operations available in BASIC and provide more, though string variables can be more
awkward to deal with.

@smallexample

@section Chapter 1: Introduction

1) A tool which translates high level language into machine language.

2) By typing the name of an executable file.

3) By typing something like "cc filename"

4) NO!

5) Compiler errors and runtime errors.

@section Chapter 2: Reserved words and an example

1) printf ("Wow big deal");

2) printf ("22");

3) printf ("The 3 wise men");
   printf ("The %d wise men",3);

4) Most facilities are held in libraries

@section Chapter 3: Operating systems and environments

1) To provide a basic set of facilities to the user

2) The filename used by a computer to reference a device

3) accounts.c

4) accounts.x (or perhaps accounts.EXE)

5) By typing the name in 4)

@section Chapter 4: Libraries

1) #include <filename> or #include "filename"

2) stdio.h

3) No. Only macro names can be used if the header file is not included.

4) Header file.

@section Chapter 6: The form of a C program

1) A group of statements enclosed by curly braces @{@}.

2) Comments, preprocessor commands, functions, declarations, variables,
statements. (This is a matter of opinion, of course.)

3) Not necessarily. It starts wherever main() is.

4) It signifies the end of a block, the return of control to something else.

5) The semi-colon (;)

@section Chapter 7: Comments

1) The compiler thinks the rest of the program is all one  comment!

@section Chapter 8: Functions

1) function (a,b)

   int a,b;

   @{
   return (a*b);
   @}

2) No.

3) The value is discarded.

4) The result is garbage.

5) By using "return".

@section Chapter 9: Variables, Types and Declarations

1) A name for some variable, function or macro

2) a,c,f

3) int i,j;

4) double is twice the length of float and can hold significantly larger values.

5) int can have values + or -. Unsigned can only be + and can hold
slightly larger + values than int.

6) I = 67;

7) int

8) At the function definition and in the calling function.

9) printf ("%d",(int)23.1256);

10) No.

@section Chapter 10: Parameters and Functions

1) With variable parameters or with return()

2) Where a function is defined, after its name: e.g.

     function (...)

     <-- here

     @{
     @}

3) Yes.

4) No and it is illegal.

5) * means "the contents of" and & means "the address of"

6) No.

@section Chapter 11: Scope : Local And Global

1) A global variable can be accessed by any part of a program.

2) A local variable can only be accessed by a select part of a program.

3) Local variables cannot leak out. Nothing outside them can reach local variables.

4) Variable parameters do. Value parameters use their own local copies, so they do not.

5)  int i,j;

    main ()

   @{ float x,y;

   another(x,y);
   @}

   another(x,y)

   float x,y;

   @{
   @}

There are 6 storage spaces altogether.

@section Chapter 12: Preprocessor Commands

1) #define birthday 19 

2) #include <math.h>

3) false

4) false

@section Chapter 13: Pointers

1) A variable which holds the address of another variable

2) With a * character. e.g. int *i;

3) Any type at all!

4) doubleptr = (double *)chptr;

5) Because number has not been initialized. This expression initializes
the place that number points to, not number itself. (See main text)

@section Chapter 14: Standard Output and Standard Input

@subsection printf

1) #include <stdio.h>

   main ()

   @{
   printf ("%2e",6.23);
   @}

2) This depends on individual compilers

3) a) No conversion string
   b) Conversion string without matching value
   c) Probably nothing
   d) Conversion string without matching value

@subsection scanf

1) space, newline or tab

5) true.

@subsection Low level I/O

1) The statement is possible provided putchar() is not implemented as a
macro. It copies the input to the output: a simple way of writing on the
screen. (Note however that the output is buffered so characters may not
be seen on the output for some time!)

2) ch = getchar();
   putchar (ch);

@section Chapter 15: Assignments, Expressions and Operators

1) The thing (or one of the things) an operator acts upon.

2) printf ("%d",5 % 2);

3) rem = 5 % 2;

4) variable = 10 - -5;

@section Chapter 16: Decisions

1) if (1 != 23)
 @{
 printf ("Thank goodness for mathematics");
 @}

@section Chapter 17: Loops

1) Three: while, do..while, for

2) while : at the start of each loop
   do    : at the end of each loop
   for   : at the start of each loop

3) do..while

4) #include <stdio.h>
   #define TRUE 1

   main ()

   @{ char ch;

   while (true)

 @{
 ch = getchar();
 putchar (ch);
 @}

@section Chapter 18: Arrays

1) The array identifier (without square brackets) is a pointer to the
first element in the array.

2) You pass the array identifier, without square brackets.
   No! Arrays are always variable parameters.

3) double array[4][5];
   Valid array bounds from array[0][0] to array[3][4]

@section Chapter 19: Strings

1) Arrays of characters. Pointers to arrays of characters.

2) static char *strings[];
  Could then initialize with braces @{@} and item list. (See main text)

3) See the Morse code example.

@section Chapter 21 Special Library Functions and Macros

1) double

2) Probably true. This is implementation dependent. The actual types are
double, long float and int.

3) The length of a string (excluding NULL byte)

4) Joins two strings.

5) Overflow, underflow, domain error, Loss of accuracy and division by zero.

@section Chapter 22: Hidden operators and values

1) ++, -- and any assignment or unary operator

2) It could make a program too difficult to read

3) No. The function would return before the value could be incremented.

@section Chapter 23: More on data types

1) FILE is defined by stdio.h It is reserved only when this file is
included. It is not a built in part of the language.

2) FILE *fp;

3) False. They are meant for comparitive purposes only. It does not make
sense to do arithmetic with enumerated data.

4) Yes. It provides a generic pointer. i.e. one which can be assigned to
any other pointer type.

5) volatile

6) typedef double real;

7) True.

@section Chapter 24: Machine Level Operations

1) Nothing -- only the way it is used. Yes, every variable is a bit
pattern. It is normal to use integer or character types for bit
patterns.

2) Inclusive OR is true if all possibilities are true
simultaneously. Exclusive OR is false if all possibilities are true
simultaneously.

3) Some kind of flag message perhaps. A bit pattern for certain.

4) a) 00000111 & 00000010 == 00000010 == 2
   b) 00000001 & 00000001 == 00000001 == 1
   c) 00001111 & 00000011 == 00000011 == 3
   d) 00001111 & 00000111 == 00000111 == 7
   e) 00001111 & 00000111 & 00000011 == 00000011 = 3

5) a) 00000001 | 00000010 == 00000011 == 3
   b) 00000001 | 00000010 | 00000011 == 00000011 == 3

6) a) 1 & (~1) == 00000001 & 11111110 == 0
   b) 23 & ~23 == 00011111 & 11100000 == 0
   c) similarly 0: n & (NOT n) is always zero

@section Chapter 25: Files and Devices

1) a) a string which labels a file
   b) a variable of type FILE * which points to a FILE structure
   c) the number of a file "portal" in the I/O array

2) High level filing performs translations to text. Low level files contain untranslated bit data.

3) fp = fopen ("filename","r");

4) fd = open ("filename",O_WRONLY);

6) fprintf()

@section Chapter 26: Structures and Unions

1) A structure can hold several values at the same time. A union holds
only one value at any one time.

2) A part of a structure, or a possible occupant of a union.

3) x.mem

4) ptr->mem

5) False.

@section Chapter 27: Data Structures

1) A diagram which shows how structures are put together.

2) With pointers.

3) False. Pointers are used to reference variables and data structures
are built in such a way as to require only one name for a whole
structure.

4) With pointers. ptr->member etc.

5) ptr=(struct Binary Tree *)malloc(sizeof(struct Binary Tree));

@section Chapter 28: Recursion

1) A function which is defined in terms of itself.

2) A data structure run by the C-language for keeping track of function calls and for storing local data.

3) A lot of memory is used as stack space.

@section Chapter 30: Errors and debugging

1) Declarations are in the wrong place.

2) Missing closing brace @}

3) Missing semi-colon after closing brace @};
